They are currently managed by the hospital’s Medical Directorate but argue that their affairs are not being properly handled. On the back of this, they are demanding the creation of a dedicated directorate. However, hospital management failure to heed their calls lead to a suspension of outpatient services at the hospital on August 2. JoyNews' visit to the central lab was greeted by a notice announcing the group's industrial action along with an apology for the inconvenience caused. At the central laboratory of the hospital, patients needing lab tests were turned away as the professional bodies say they will not return to work until their demands are met.

            "News: Rating agency, Fitch, has stated that it will assign a Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Ghana once the country reaches an agreement with private creditors on the restructuring of its Foreign Currency - denominated external debt and completes that restructuring process. This it added will be based on a forward-looking assessment of its willingness and capacity to honour its foreign-currency debt. Fitch which recently affirmed Ghana at ‘Restrictive Default’ said the LTLC IDR would be upgraded on reduced liquidity pressures, potentially following the completion of the external debt treatment. For example, restoring macroeconomic stability would significantly lower debt interest costs. Fitch's proprietary Sovereign Rating Model assigns Ghana a score equivalent to a rating of 'B-' on the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR scale. However, per its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee has not utilised the SRM and Qualitative Overlay to explain the ratings. Country Ceiling The Country Ceiling for Ghana is 'B-'. For sovereigns rated 'CCC+' and below, Fitch assumes a starting point of 'CCC+' for determining the Country Ceiling. Fitch's Country Ceiling Model produced a starting point uplift of +0 notch above the IDR. Fitch's rating committee applied a +1-notch qualitative adjustment to the model result under the Balance of Payments Restrictions pillar. The Country Ceiling of 'B-' reflects that the private sector has not been prevented or significantly impeded from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments.\n",

            "News: The Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) says it has resolved the impasse between the Council Chairman of the University of Cape Coast (UCC), Prof. S H Amonoo-Koafi and the rest of the University Community over the termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Johnson Nyarko Boampong recently. The GTEC which is the regulator of tertiary institutions in the country has rewritten to the Vice Chancellor to remain in office while all issues about his appointment are being looked at with all stakeholders to bring lasting peace on campus. Prof. Ahmed Abdulai Jinapor, in a letter dated August 2, 2024, directed the Registrar of the University to furnish his office with all relevant documents -concerning the renewal and purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor to avoid interruption in the management of the University. He also directed that all correspondence, court processes and communiques on the matter be forwarded to the Commission for perusal so that the matter can be handled prudently. Background It could be recalled that the name of UCC has been in the news on social media and in the traditional media for the past week following the purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor of the University by the Council Chairman. This has led to seeming tension among the University Community as various stakeholders keep threatening to embark on protests towards the restoration of the VC back to his post. It is based on this, that GTEC, has ordered the reinstatement of the VC to his position while the matter is handled professionally to ensure free and fair operations on the campus of the university. Seven members of the UCC Governing Council who call themselves “Concerned members of UCC Governing Council” in a letter on 1st August 2024 stated that the issue of termination of appointment was not discussed at their last meeting held on 30th July 2024 and wondered why the Council Chairman can do such a thing. They challenged the Council Chairman to produce any such minutes if there is to confirm his case.Apart from the “Concerned Governing Council” members, the UCC branch of the University Teachers Association (UTAG) and other institutions have all expressed their displeasure with the termination of the VC’s appointment describing it as a sole decision of the Council Chairman.\n",

            "News: Vice President of IMANI Africa, Selorm Branttie, has condemned what he calls attempts by some persons to alter Ghana's historical records to achieve their parochial interest. His remark is in response to President Akufo-Addo’s recent statement rejecting the notion that Ghana was solely founded by Kwame Nkrumah. Akufo-Addo highlighted that the struggle for Ghana's independence was a collective effort spanning several generations. “I speak to you this evening, rejecting completely, the notion that Ghana was founded by one man. While Kwame Nkrumah’s contributions to our independence are undeniable, it is important to acknowledge for ourselves that respect that the struggle for our nation’s freedom was a collective effort spanning several generations,” President Akufo-Addo said. But Mr Branttie emphasised that Ghana's first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, was instrumental in establishing Ghana as a republic in 1960. In an interview with Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, Mr Branttie acknowledged President Akufo-Addo's view but emphasised Nkrumah's unique role. “There might be historical perspectives that I am unaware of, but the records show that one person, Kwame Nkrumah, was pivotal in advocating for self-government,” he said. Mr Branttie elaborated, noting that Nkrumah was the key figure who initiated the call for self-government, faced imprisonment for his activism, and mobilized national support, compelling the colonial administration to grant self-governance. “Nkrumah demanded immediate self-government and took decisive action. Others did not; some even criticized him. Now, those who opposed him cannot claim a share in his achievements,” he argued. “He [President Akufo-Addo] might have some historical perspective that I don’t know, but what has been recorded there was only one person who created the advocacy for self-government.\"He further stressed the importance of acknowledging historical facts. “People have done those actions and they were recorded, let’s not try to change what is there to satisfy somebody’s failure or family reputation. “What is it is what it is, Nkrumah’s advocacy for immediate self-government was crucial. Without his decisive actions, Ghana might not have become a republic in 1960. His efforts marked a significant turning point in our nation’s history.” Read also : ‘I reject completely the notion that Ghana was founded by Kwame Nkrumah alone’ – Akufo-Addo\n",

Addressing party supporters during his tour of the Upper East region, the former President explained that many in the NPP believe that power is being controlled by a selected few, hence the need for them to go back to opposition. \"There are many of my friends in the NPP who come and tell me, 'NDC, you have to do well and get our party out of power'. \"These are NPP people because the NPP has been captured by a small group of people. This is not Kufuor's group of people…This is not Kufuor's NPP. This is a different NPP. It has been hijacked by some people and so the democrats and others in NPP actually want the party to lose so that they can go back into opposition so that they can go and reorganize,\" he stressed. The NDC flagbearer also promised to complete all projects abandoned by the Akufo-Addo administration when voted into power on December 7. According to him, it was important to complete ongoing projects before embarking on any new projects to help save scarce resources. Addressing the chiefs and queen mothers at the Bawku Naaba's Palace in the Upper East Region, the former President said it was disheartening to realise that most projects started by the NDC government have been abandoned by NPP. “I cut sod to start the Tamne irrigation project and we didn’t complete it before we left. We finished phase one; this government continued it slowly but still, it hasn’t been done. This project will bring about 3000 hectares of land under irrigation so that our young people can do dry season gardening, they can do all-year-round gardening so that they don’t go down South to look for menial jobs. “So, when we come, we’ll continue the Tamne project because we know it’s going to benefit four districts in this area,” he said.\n",

            "News: A former Speaker of Parliament, Prof Mike Oquaye, has asserted that Ghanaians owe the freedom they enjoy today to the efforts of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). He emphasised that the party, particularly through the contributions of its key historical figures, played a crucial role in embedding human rights into the nation's constitutional framework. Prof Oquaye claimed that during Dr Kwame Nkrumah’s tenure, there was minimal regard for the protection of human rights. He suggested that it was under the leadership of the NPP and its predecessors that significant advancements in human rights were made. He expressed these views at a mentorship programme organized by the NPP Council of Elders. The event, part of the 77th anniversary celebration of the formation of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), aimed to educate young patriots on the Danquah-Busia-Dombo tradition and its contributions to Ghana's political and social landscape. Prof Oquaye highlighted that it was the late President Edward Akufo-Addo who first introduced a human rights chapter in the 1969 constitution. According to him, this groundbreaking inclusion set the foundation for the protection of human rights, which has been carried forward and incorporated into subsequent constitutions. “Our forebearers brought this kind of thing. Under Nkrumah, you could be detained almost indefinitely. Why? First of all, PDA [Preventive Detention Act] allowed your detention under the 1958 law for 5 years. When it got to 1964, he amended it and said after that, you could be given a renewal for another 5 years, almost indefinite. “Nobody likes that today, nevertheless, they see a hero in the man who perpetrated it against the people of Ghana, it’s a contradiction. We must claim it, and we must know that if you love your freedom, you must love the NPP in Ghana today. Our people were developmental, selfless gentlemen, development-oriented and they spoke about it, all the time,\" he stated.\n",

            "News: The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) has initiated an investigation into suspected corruption and related offences exposed in JoyNews' recent documentary, \"Porous Borders\". The OSP has requested the unedited footage of the documentary to facilitate a thorough investigation into alleged bribery and corruption involving some staff of the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). The OSP becomes the third public institution to respond to the documentary, following reactions from Parliament and the GRA. Porous Borders showcased real-time footage of corrupt activities by some customs officials at Ghana's eastern border. In the wake of the documentary's release, the Customs Division of the GRA announced on July 31 that it had assembled a team to investigate the corruption claims. Parliament also reacted, with Yusif Suleiman, Ranking Member on the Trade and Industry Committee and MP for Bole-Bamboi, describing the country as \"sick\" after viewing the exposé. On August 2, 2024, the Special Prosecutor confirmed the commencement of an investigation into the allegations in the documentary. The office has formally requested the documentary's unedited recordings to support its inquiry. Additionally, the documentary producers have been invited to assist with the investigation as witnesses.

            "News: A research fellow at CDD-Ghana Kwame Sarpong Asiedu, has stated that the Ghana we know today is the result of Kwame Nkrumah's vision. According to Asiedu, Nkrumah played a pivotal role in shaping Ghana and was crucial in establishing the country as a republic. Mr Asiedu acknowledged that while several others contributed to Ghana's liberation from colonial rule, it was Nkrumah’s ideas and leadership that fundamentally shaped the modern nation. “While many contributed to our fight against colonialism, it was Kwame Nkrumah's vision that defined the Ghana we see today. His contributions were crucial in forming the country as it is now,” Asiedu said. This statement follows President Akufo-Addo’s recent remarks rejecting the idea that Ghana was founded solely by Nkrumah. President Akufo-Addo emphasized the collective effort of many leaders in Ghana’s liberation. Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, August 5, Mr Asiedu explained that, “The entity Ghana if you tell me that people contributed to our liberation from colonialism I agree, and their effort should not be discouraged. What I’m saying is that their contribution was towards our liberation, but to the formation of the country Ghana as we see it today, it was Kwame Nkrumah's thinking and we cannot take that away from him, because it is clearly stated.” He noted that by 1951, there were differing opinions on whether to pursue immediate or gradual independence for the Gold Coast. He questioned why the very people who wrote a letter to the British not to grant independence as was being sought by Kwame Nkrumah and wanted what has come to be known as Ghana today to be dismembered into different nations, are suddenly claiming to be founders. Asiedu emphasized the importance of maintaining historical accuracy. “We should not allow anyone to rewrite history. The evidence is clear and well-documented.” He also highlighted that from Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957, to the establishment of the First Republic on July 1, 1960, Nkrumah’s role was undisputed. It was only after the government changed hands in 2017 that attempts to alter historical narratives emerged. “In my view, returning to the established historical record is the best course of action. The evidence is clear: Ghana as we know it today is the result of Nkrumah’s vision. Without it, the identity of the nation could have been very different,” Asiedu concluded.

            "News: A former Senior Governance Advisor at the United Nations, Professor Baffour Agyeman-Duah, has stated that the contributions of Ghana's first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, cannot be understated. According to him, despite personal disagreements with some of Nkrumah's domestic policies, Nkrumah's contributions to Ghana's development merit full recognition. In his 2024 Founders’ Day address on Saturday, August 3, President Akufo-Addo firmly rejected the idea that Ghana was founded by a single individual. The president disagreed with claims that Kwame Nkrumah single-handedly founded Ghana, emphasising the collective efforts of many individuals in the independence struggle. While acknowledging Nkrumah's undeniable contribution, he stressed that Nkrumah was not the sole architect of Ghana's independence. Speaking on the JoyNews AM show, Professor Agyeman-Duah said, “No matter what you say, Nkrumah stands tall in our politics, and nobody can belittle his accomplishment. \"Even though personally as I speak, there were certain domestic policies that I never liked and still don’t like, but still, even after discounting all those negativities, Nkrumah is a person that deserves the fullest recognition. After all, he (Nkrumah) was the man of the millennium, and that in itself says it all.\" Prof Agyeman-Duah stated that while several people contributed intellectually to the founding of Ghana, it was Kwame Nkrumah alone who shaped the nation's ideological and emotional aspects. He emphasised that understanding who founded Ghana requires acknowledging Nkrumah's ideological and emotional contributions while also recognising the significant role of the UGCC [United Gold Coast Convention]. “After all, they [UGCC] brought Nkrumah; perhaps even if they had not brought him, he was going to come himself. Yet he was brought down to help them achieve independence. How can you take that away?” he quizzed.\n",

            "Link: https://www.myjoyonline.com/yellow-ghana-proposes-alternative-to-ndcs-24-hour-economy-policy-yellow-ghana/\n",
            "News: The flagbearer of Yellow Ghana, Samuel Apea-Danquah, says that the goals of President John Mahama and the NDC's 24-hour economy policy can be more effectively achieved through two of Yellow Ghana's proposed Labour Reforms. According to him, these reforms, detailed on Page 83 of their manifesto, involve setting maximum working hours and implementing a freeze on overtime. Mr Apea-Danquah believes that these measures will promote sustainable job creation and economic stability without the drawbacks associated with the 24-hour economy. In a Facebook post by Yellow Ghana, it stated that “Maximum Working Hours: By setting a cap on the number of working hours per week, we ensure that employees are not overworked and have a balanced life. This policy promotes better health, higher productivity, and a more motivated workforce. It also encourages businesses to hire more employees to meet their operational needs, thereby creating more jobs. Mr  Apea-Danquah noted that “Freeze on Overtime: Implementing a freeze on overtime prevents the exploitation of workers and ensures that businesses do not rely on excessive overtime to meet their targets. This policy promotes the hiring of additional staff, spreading employment opportunities more evenly, and reducing unemployment rates.” It added that Yellow Ghana's labour reforms involve increasing the minimum wage to $3.55 per day, with automatic adjustments. Mr  Apea-Danquah said this initiative aims to ensure that workers receive a living wage, securing a decent standard of living. The statement said by focusing on fair wages, the party seeks to not only enhance citizens' quality of life but also boost economic growth through greater consumer spending. The statement stressed that the party's objective is not just to create jobs for statistical purposes but to ensure these jobs provide wages that guarantee a decent standard of living. “Yellow Ghana’s approach is grounded in practicality and fairness, aiming to create a robust economy where every citizen can thrive. \"In conclusion, the goals of the NDC's 24-hour economy policy can be achieved more effectively and sustainably through Yellow Ghana’s Labour Reforms. We offer a balanced and realistic approach that respects the well-being of our workforce and promotes genuine economic growth. Ghana deserves better, and Yellow Ghana is committed to delivering policies that truly benefit our people.”\n",

            "Link: https://www.myjoyonline.com/well-upgrade-ghanas-rating-once-it-reaches-agreement-with-private-creditors-fitch/\n",
            "Summary: Rating agency, Fitch, has stated that it will assign a Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Ghana once the country reaches an agreement with private creditors on the restructuring of its Foreign Currency - denominated external debt and completes that restructuring process. This it added will be based on a forward-looking assessment of its willingness and capacity to honour its foreign-currency debt. Fitch which recently affirmed Ghana at ‘Restrictive Default’ said the LTLC IDR would be upgraded on reduced liquidity pressures, potentially following the completion of the external debt treatment. For example, restoring macroeconomic stability would significantly lower debt interest costs. Fitch's proprietary Sovereign Rating Model assigns Ghana a score equivalent to a rating of 'B-' on the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR scale. However, per its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee has not utilised the SRM and Qualitative Overlay to explain the ratings. Country Ceiling The Country Ceiling for Ghana is 'B-'. For sovereigns rated 'CCC+' and below, Fitch assumes a starting point of 'CCC+' for determining the Country Ceiling. Fitch's Country Ceiling Model produced a starting point uplift of +0 notch above the IDR. Fitch's rating committee applied a +1-notch qualitative adjustment to the model result under the Balance of Payments Restrictions pillar. The Country Ceiling of 'B-' reflects that the private sector has not been prevented or significantly impeded from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments.\n",

            "Summary: The Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) says it has resolved the impasse between the Council Chairman of the University of Cape Coast (UCC), Prof. S H Amonoo-Koafi and the rest of the University Community over the termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Johnson Nyarko Boampong recently. The GTEC which is the regulator of tertiary institutions in the country has rewritten to the Vice Chancellor to remain in office while all issues about his appointment are being looked at with all stakeholders to bring lasting peace on campus. Prof. Ahmed Abdulai Jinapor, in a letter dated August 2, 2024, directed the Registrar of the University to furnish his office with all relevant documents -concerning the renewal and purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor to avoid interruption in the management of the University. He also directed that all correspondence, court processes and communiques on the matter be forwarded to the Commission for perusal so that the matter can be handled prudently. Background It could be recalled that the name of UCC has been in the news on social media and in the traditional media for the past week following the purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor of the University by the Council Chairman. This has led to seeming tension among the University Community as various stakeholders keep threatening to embark on protests towards the restoration of the VC back to his post. It is based on this, that GTEC, has ordered the reinstatement of the VC to his position while the matter is handled professionally to ensure free and fair operations on the campus of the university. Seven members of the UCC Governing Council who call themselves “Concerned members of UCC Governing Council” in a letter on 1st August 2024 stated that the issue of termination of appointment was not discussed at their last meeting held on 30th July 2024 and wondered why the Council Chairman can do such a thing. They challenged the Council Chairman to produce any such minutes if there is to confirm his case.Apart from the “Concerned Governing Council” members, the UCC branch of the University Teachers Association (UTAG) and other institutions have all expressed their displeasure with the termination of the VC’s appointment describing it as a sole decision of the Council Chairman.\n",

            "Summary: Vice President of IMANI Africa, Selorm Branttie, has condemned what he calls attempts by some persons to alter Ghana's historical records to achieve their parochial interest. His remark is in response to President Akufo-Addo’s recent statement rejecting the notion that Ghana was solely founded by Kwame Nkrumah. Akufo-Addo highlighted that the struggle for Ghana's independence was a collective effort spanning several generations. “I speak to you this evening, rejecting completely, the notion that Ghana was founded by one man. While Kwame Nkrumah’s contributions to our independence are undeniable, it is important to acknowledge for ourselves that respect that the struggle for our nation’s freedom was a collective effort spanning several generations,” President Akufo-Addo said. But Mr Branttie emphasised that Ghana's first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, was instrumental in establishing Ghana as a republic in 1960. In an interview with Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, Mr Branttie acknowledged President Akufo-Addo's view but emphasised Nkrumah's unique role. “There might be historical perspectives that I am unaware of, but the records show that one person, Kwame Nkrumah, was pivotal in advocating for self-government,” he said. Mr Branttie elaborated, noting that Nkrumah was the key figure who initiated the call for self-government, faced imprisonment for his activism, and mobilized national support, compelling the colonial administration to grant self-governance. “Nkrumah demanded immediate self-government and took decisive action. Others did not; some even criticized him. Now, those who opposed him cannot claim a share in his achievements,” he argued. “He [President Akufo-Addo] might have some historical perspective that I don’t know, but what has been recorded there was only one person who created the advocacy for self-government.\"He further stressed the importance of acknowledging historical facts. “People have done those actions and they were recorded, let’s not try to change what is there to satisfy somebody’s failure or family reputation. “What is it is what it is, Nkrumah’s advocacy for immediate self-government was crucial. Without his decisive actions, Ghana might not have become a republic in 1960. His efforts marked a significant turning point in our nation’s history.” Read also : ‘I reject completely the notion that Ghana was founded by Kwame Nkrumah alone’ – Akufo-Addo\n",

            "Summary: The 2024 Presidential candidate for the National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama says some New Patriotic Party (NPP) members are privately anticipating his victory in the December 7 general elections. This, according to him, is because they believe the defeat of the NPP will facilitate the governing party's reorganization. Addressing party supporters during his tour of the Upper East region, the former President explained that many in the NPP believe that power is being controlled by a selected few, hence the need for them to go back to opposition. \"There are many of my friends in the NPP who come and tell me, 'NDC, you have to do well and get our party out of power'. \"These are NPP people because the NPP has been captured by a small group of people. This is not Kufuor's group of people…This is not Kufuor's NPP. This is a different NPP. It has been hijacked by some people and so the democrats and others in NPP actually want the party to lose so that they can go back into opposition so that they can go and reorganize,\" he stressed. The NDC flagbearer also promised to complete all projects abandoned by the Akufo-Addo administration when voted into power on December 7. According to him, it was important to complete ongoing projects before embarking on any new projects to help save scarce resources. Addressing the chiefs and queen mothers at the Bawku Naaba's Palace in the Upper East Region, the former President said it was disheartening to realise that most projects started by the NDC government have been abandoned by NPP. “I cut sod to start the Tamne irrigation project and we didn’t complete it before we left. We finished phase one; this government continued it slowly but still, it hasn’t been done. This project will bring about 3000 hectares of land under irrigation so that our young people can do dry season gardening, they can do all-year-round gardening so that they don’t go down South to look for menial jobs. “So, when we come, we’ll continue the Tamne project because we know it’s going to benefit four districts in this area,” he said.\n",

            "Summary: A former Speaker of Parliament, Prof Mike Oquaye, has asserted that Ghanaians owe the freedom they enjoy today to the efforts of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). He emphasised that the party, particularly through the contributions of its key historical figures, played a crucial role in embedding human rights into the nation's constitutional framework. Prof Oquaye claimed that during Dr Kwame Nkrumah’s tenure, there was minimal regard for the protection of human rights. He suggested that it was under the leadership of the NPP and its predecessors that significant advancements in human rights were made. He expressed these views at a mentorship programme organized by the NPP Council of Elders. The event, part of the 77th anniversary celebration of the formation of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), aimed to educate young patriots on the Danquah-Busia-Dombo tradition and its contributions to Ghana's political and social landscape. Prof Oquaye highlighted that it was the late President Edward Akufo-Addo who first introduced a human rights chapter in the 1969 constitution. According to him, this groundbreaking inclusion set the foundation for the protection of human rights, which has been carried forward and incorporated into subsequent constitutions. “Our forebearers brought this kind of thing. Under Nkrumah, you could be detained almost indefinitely. Why? First of all, PDA [Preventive Detention Act] allowed your detention under the 1958 law for 5 years. When it got to 1964, he amended it and said after that, you could be given a renewal for another 5 years, almost indefinite. “Nobody likes that today, nevertheless, they see a hero in the man who perpetrated it against the people of Ghana, it’s a contradiction. We must claim it, and we must know that if you love your freedom, you must love the NPP in Ghana today. Our people were developmental, selfless gentlemen, development-oriented and they spoke about it, all the time,\" he stated.\n",

            "Summary: The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) has initiated an investigation into suspected corruption and related offences exposed in JoyNews' recent documentary, \"Porous Borders\". The OSP has requested the unedited footage of the documentary to facilitate a thorough investigation into alleged bribery and corruption involving some staff of the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). The OSP becomes the third public institution to respond to the documentary, following reactions from Parliament and the GRA. Porous Borders showcased real-time footage of corrupt activities by some customs officials at Ghana's eastern border. In the wake of the documentary's release, the Customs Division of the GRA announced on July 31 that it had assembled a team to investigate the corruption claims. Parliament also reacted, with Yusif Suleiman, Ranking Member on the Trade and Industry Committee and MP for Bole-Bamboi, describing the country as \"sick\" after viewing the exposé. On August 2, 2024, the Special Prosecutor confirmed the commencement of an investigation into the allegations in the documentary. The office has formally requested the documentary's unedited recordings to support its inquiry. Additionally, the documentary producers have been invited to assist with the investigation as witnesses.

            "Summary: A research fellow at CDD-Ghana Kwame Sarpong Asiedu, has stated that the Ghana we know today is the result of Kwame Nkrumah's vision. According to Asiedu, Nkrumah played a pivotal role in shaping Ghana and was crucial in establishing the country as a republic. Mr Asiedu acknowledged that while several others contributed to Ghana's liberation from colonial rule, it was Nkrumah’s ideas and leadership that fundamentally shaped the modern nation. “While many contributed to our fight against colonialism, it was Kwame Nkrumah's vision that defined the Ghana we see today. His contributions were crucial in forming the country as it is now,” Asiedu said. This statement follows President Akufo-Addo’s recent remarks rejecting the idea that Ghana was founded solely by Nkrumah. President Akufo-Addo emphasized the collective effort of many leaders in Ghana’s liberation. Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, August 5, Mr Asiedu explained that, “The entity Ghana if you tell me that people contributed to our liberation from colonialism I agree, and their effort should not be discouraged. What I’m saying is that their contribution was towards our liberation, but to the formation of the country Ghana as we see it today, it was Kwame Nkrumah's thinking and we cannot take that away from him, because it is clearly stated.” He noted that by 1951, there were differing opinions on whether to pursue immediate or gradual independence for the Gold Coast. He questioned why the very people who wrote a letter to the British not to grant independence as was being sought by Kwame Nkrumah and wanted what has come to be known as Ghana today to be dismembered into different nations, are suddenly claiming to be founders. Asiedu emphasized the importance of maintaining historical accuracy. “We should not allow anyone to rewrite history. The evidence is clear and well-documented.” He also highlighted that from Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957, to the establishment of the First Republic on July 1, 1960, Nkrumah’s role was undisputed. It was only after the government changed hands in 2017 that attempts to alter historical narratives emerged. “In my view, returning to the established historical record is the best course of action. The evidence is clear: Ghana as we know it today is the result of Nkrumah’s vision. Without it, the identity of the nation could have been very different,” Asiedu concluded.

            "Summary: A former Senior Governance Advisor at the United Nations, Professor Baffour Agyeman-Duah, has stated that the contributions of Ghana's first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, cannot be understated. According to him, despite personal disagreements with some of Nkrumah's domestic policies, Nkrumah's contributions to Ghana's development merit full recognition. In his 2024 Founders’ Day address on Saturday, August 3, President Akufo-Addo firmly rejected the idea that Ghana was founded by a single individual. The president disagreed with claims that Kwame Nkrumah single-handedly founded Ghana, emphasising the collective efforts of many individuals in the independence struggle. While acknowledging Nkrumah's undeniable contribution, he stressed that Nkrumah was not the sole architect of Ghana's independence. Speaking on the JoyNews AM show, Professor Agyeman-Duah said, “No matter what you say, Nkrumah stands tall in our politics, and nobody can belittle his accomplishment. \"Even though personally as I speak, there were certain domestic policies that I never liked and still don’t like, but still, even after discounting all those negativities, Nkrumah is a person that deserves the fullest recognition. After all, he (Nkrumah) was the man of the millennium, and that in itself says it all.\" Prof Agyeman-Duah stated that while several people contributed intellectually to the founding of Ghana, it was Kwame Nkrumah alone who shaped the nation's ideological and emotional aspects. He emphasised that understanding who founded Ghana requires acknowledging Nkrumah's ideological and emotional contributions while also recognising the significant role of the UGCC [United Gold Coast Convention]. “After all, they [UGCC] brought Nkrumah; perhaps even if they had not brought him, he was going to come himself. Yet he was brought down to help them achieve independence. How can you take that away?” he quizzed.\n",

            "Summary: The flagbearer of Yellow Ghana, Samuel Apea-Danquah, says that the goals of President John Mahama and the NDC's 24-hour economy policy can be more effectively achieved through two of Yellow Ghana's proposed Labour Reforms. According to him, these reforms, detailed on Page 83 of their manifesto, involve setting maximum working hours and implementing a freeze on overtime. Mr Apea-Danquah believes that these measures will promote sustainable job creation and economic stability without the drawbacks associated with the 24-hour economy. In a Facebook post by Yellow Ghana, it stated that “Maximum Working Hours: By setting a cap on the number of working hours per week, we ensure that employees are not overworked and have a balanced life. This policy promotes better health, higher productivity, and a more motivated workforce. It also encourages businesses to hire more employees to meet their operational needs, thereby creating more jobs. Mr  Apea-Danquah noted that “Freeze on Overtime: Implementing a freeze on overtime prevents the exploitation of workers and ensures that businesses do not rely on excessive overtime to meet their targets. This policy promotes the hiring of additional staff, spreading employment opportunities more evenly, and reducing unemployment rates.” It added that Yellow Ghana's labour reforms involve increasing the minimum wage to $3.55 per day, with automatic adjustments. Mr  Apea-Danquah said this initiative aims to ensure that workers receive a living wage, securing a decent standard of living. The statement said by focusing on fair wages, the party seeks to not only enhance citizens' quality of life but also boost economic growth through greater consumer spending. The statement stressed that the party's objective is not just to create jobs for statistical purposes but to ensure these jobs provide wages that guarantee a decent standard of living. “Yellow Ghana’s approach is grounded in practicality and fairness, aiming to create a robust economy where every citizen can thrive. \"In conclusion, the goals of the NDC's 24-hour economy policy can be achieved more effectively and sustainably through Yellow Ghana’s Labour Reforms. We offer a balanced and realistic approach that respects the well-being of our workforce and promotes genuine economic growth. Ghana deserves better, and Yellow Ghana is committed to delivering policies that truly benefit our people.”\n",

This group includes the Ghana Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists, the Ghana Physiotherapy Association, and the Ghana Society of Radiographers, among 15 other professional associations that announced a strike on Wednesday, July 31. They are currently managed by the hospital’s Medical Directorate but argue that their affairs are not being properly handled. On the back of this, they are demanding the creation of a dedicated directorate. However, hospital management failure to heed their calls lead to a suspension of outpatient services at the hospital on August 2. JoyNews' visit to the central lab was greeted by a notice announcing the group's industrial action along with an apology for the inconvenience caused. At the central laboratory of the hospital, patients needing lab tests were turned away as the professional bodies say they will not return to work until their demands are met. Upon entering the facility, four individuals were seated in the waiting area, with empty offices. The few people present decided to make use of the facility by watching television.\n",

            "Link: https://www.myjoyonline.com/well-upgrade-ghanas-rating-once-it-reaches-agreement-with-private-creditors-fitch/\n",
            "Summary: Rating agency, Fitch, has stated that it will assign a Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Ghana once the country reaches an agreement with private creditors on the restructuring of its Foreign Currency - denominated external debt and completes that restructuring process. This it added will be based on a forward-looking assessment of its willingness and capacity to honour its foreign-currency debt. Fitch which recently affirmed Ghana at ‘Restrictive Default’ said the LTLC IDR would be upgraded on reduced liquidity pressures, potentially following the completion of the external debt treatment. For example, restoring macroeconomic stability would significantly lower debt interest costs. Fitch's proprietary Sovereign Rating Model assigns Ghana a score equivalent to a rating of 'B-' on the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR scale. However, per its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee has not utilised the SRM and Qualitative Overlay to explain the ratings. Country Ceiling The Country Ceiling for Ghana is 'B-'. For sovereigns rated 'CCC+' and below, Fitch assumes a starting point of 'CCC+' for determining the Country Ceiling. Fitch's Country Ceiling Model produced a starting point uplift of +0 notch above the IDR. Fitch's rating committee applied a +1-notch qualitative adjustment to the model result under the Balance of Payments Restrictions pillar. The Country Ceiling of 'B-' reflects that the private sector has not been prevented or significantly impeded from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments.\n",

            "Summary: The Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) says it has resolved the impasse between the Council Chairman of the University of Cape Coast (UCC), Prof. S H Amonoo-Koafi and the rest of the University Community over the termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Johnson Nyarko Boampong recently. The GTEC which is the regulator of tertiary institutions in the country has rewritten to the Vice Chancellor to remain in office while all issues about his appointment are being looked at with all stakeholders to bring lasting peace on campus. Prof. Ahmed Abdulai Jinapor, in a letter dated August 2, 2024, directed the Registrar of the University to furnish his office with all relevant documents -concerning the renewal and purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor to avoid interruption in the management of the University. He also directed that all correspondence, court processes and communiques on the matter be forwarded to the Commission for perusal so that the matter can be handled prudently. Background It could be recalled that the name of UCC has been in the news on social media and in the traditional media for the past week following the purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor of the University by the Council Chairman. This has led to seeming tension among the University Community as various stakeholders keep threatening to embark on protests towards the restoration of the VC back to his post. It is based on this, that GTEC, has ordered the reinstatement of the VC to his position while the matter is handled professionally to ensure free and fair operations on the campus of the university. Seven members of the UCC Governing Council who call themselves “Concerned members of UCC Governing Council” in a letter on 1st August 2024 stated that the issue of termination of appointment was not discussed at their last meeting held on 30th July 2024 and wondered why the Council Chairman can do such a thing. They challenged the Council Chairman to produce any such minutes if there is to confirm his case.Apart from the “Concerned Governing Council” members, the UCC branch of the University Teachers Association (UTAG) and other institutions have all expressed their displeasure with the termination of the VC’s appointment describing it as a sole decision of the Council Chairman.\n",

            "Summary: Vice President of IMANI Africa, Selorm Branttie, has condemned what he calls attempts by some persons to alter Ghana's historical records to achieve their parochial interest. His remark is in response to President Akufo-Addo’s recent statement rejecting the notion that Ghana was solely founded by Kwame Nkrumah. Akufo-Addo highlighted that the struggle for Ghana's independence was a collective effort spanning several generations. “I speak to you this evening, rejecting completely, the notion that Ghana was founded by one man. While Kwame Nkrumah’s contributions to our independence are undeniable, it is important to acknowledge for ourselves that respect that the struggle for our nation’s freedom was a collective effort spanning several generations,” President Akufo-Addo said. But Mr Branttie emphasised that Ghana's first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, was instrumental in establishing Ghana as a republic in 1960. In an interview with Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, Mr Branttie acknowledged President Akufo-Addo's view but emphasised Nkrumah's unique role. “There might be historical perspectives that I am unaware of, but the records show that one person, Kwame Nkrumah, was pivotal in advocating for self-government,” he said. Mr Branttie elaborated, noting that Nkrumah was the key figure who initiated the call for self-government, faced imprisonment for his activism, and mobilized national support, compelling the colonial administration to grant self-governance. “Nkrumah demanded immediate self-government and took decisive action. Others did not; some even criticized him. Now, those who opposed him cannot claim a share in his achievements,” he argued. “He [President Akufo-Addo] might have some historical perspective that I don’t know, but what has been recorded there was only one person who created the advocacy for self-government.\"He further stressed the importance of acknowledging historical facts. “People have done those actions and they were recorded, let’s not try to change what is there to satisfy somebody’s failure or family reputation. “What is it is what it is, Nkrumah’s advocacy for immediate self-government was crucial. Without his decisive actions, Ghana might not have become a republic in 1960. His efforts marked a significant turning point in our nation’s history.” Read also : ‘I reject completely the notion that Ghana was founded by Kwame Nkrumah alone’ – Akufo-Addo\n",

            "Summary: The 2024 Presidential candidate for the National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama says some New Patriotic Party (NPP) members are privately anticipating his victory in the December 7 general elections. This, according to him, is because they believe the defeat of the NPP will facilitate the governing party's reorganization. Addressing party supporters during his tour of the Upper East region, the former President explained that many in the NPP believe that power is being controlled by a selected few, hence the need for them to go back to opposition. \"There are many of my friends in the NPP who come and tell me, 'NDC, you have to do well and get our party out of power'. \"These are NPP people because the NPP has been captured by a small group of people. This is not Kufuor's group of people…This is not Kufuor's NPP. This is a different NPP. It has been hijacked by some people and so the democrats and others in NPP actually want the party to lose so that they can go back into opposition so that they can go and reorganize,\" he stressed. The NDC flagbearer also promised to complete all projects abandoned by the Akufo-Addo administration when voted into power on December 7. According to him, it was important to complete ongoing projects before embarking on any new projects to help save scarce resources. Addressing the chiefs and queen mothers at the Bawku Naaba's Palace in the Upper East Region, the former President said it was disheartening to realise that most projects started by the NDC government have been abandoned by NPP. “I cut sod to start the Tamne irrigation project and we didn’t complete it before we left. We finished phase one; this government continued it slowly but still, it hasn’t been done. This project will bring about 3000 hectares of land under irrigation so that our young people can do dry season gardening, they can do all-year-round gardening so that they don’t go down South to look for menial jobs. “So, when we come, we’ll continue the Tamne project because we know it’s going to benefit four districts in this area,” he said.\n",

            "Summary: A former Speaker of Parliament, Prof Mike Oquaye, has asserted that Ghanaians owe the freedom they enjoy today to the efforts of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). He emphasised that the party, particularly through the contributions of its key historical figures, played a crucial role in embedding human rights into the nation's constitutional framework. Prof Oquaye claimed that during Dr Kwame Nkrumah’s tenure, there was minimal regard for the protection of human rights. He suggested that it was under the leadership of the NPP and its predecessors that significant advancements in human rights were made. He expressed these views at a mentorship programme organized by the NPP Council of Elders. The event, part of the 77th anniversary celebration of the formation of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), aimed to educate young patriots on the Danquah-Busia-Dombo tradition and its contributions to Ghana's political and social landscape. Prof Oquaye highlighted that it was the late President Edward Akufo-Addo who first introduced a human rights chapter in the 1969 constitution. According to him, this groundbreaking inclusion set the foundation for the protection of human rights, which has been carried forward and incorporated into subsequent constitutions. “Our forebearers brought this kind of thing. Under Nkrumah, you could be detained almost indefinitely. Why? First of all, PDA [Preventive Detention Act] allowed your detention under the 1958 law for 5 years. When it got to 1964, he amended it and said after that, you could be given a renewal for another 5 years, almost indefinite. “Nobody likes that today, nevertheless, they see a hero in the man who perpetrated it against the people of Ghana, it’s a contradiction. We must claim it, and we must know that if you love your freedom, you must love the NPP in Ghana today. Our people were developmental, selfless gentlemen, development-oriented and they spoke about it, all the time,\" he stated.\n",

The OSP has requested the unedited footage of the documentary to facilitate a thorough investigation into alleged bribery and corruption involving some staff of the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). The OSP becomes the third public institution to respond to the documentary, following reactions from Parliament and the GRA. Porous Borders showcased real-time footage of corrupt activities by some customs officials at Ghana's eastern border. In the wake of the documentary's release, the Customs Division of the GRA announced on July 31 that it had assembled a team to investigate the corruption claims. Parliament also reacted, with Yusif Suleiman, Ranking Member on the Trade and Industry Committee and MP for Bole-Bamboi, describing the country as \"sick\" after viewing the exposé. On August 2, 2024, the Special Prosecutor confirmed the commencement of an investigation into the allegations in the documentary.

            "Summary: A research fellow at CDD-Ghana Kwame Sarpong Asiedu, has stated that the Ghana we know today is the result of Kwame Nkrumah's vision. According to Asiedu, Nkrumah played a pivotal role in shaping Ghana and was crucial in establishing the country as a republic. Mr Asiedu acknowledged that while several others contributed to Ghana's liberation from colonial rule, it was Nkrumah’s ideas and leadership that fundamentally shaped the modern nation. “While many contributed to our fight against colonialism, it was Kwame Nkrumah's vision that defined the Ghana we see today. His contributions were crucial in forming the country as it is now,” Asiedu said. This statement follows President Akufo-Addo’s recent remarks rejecting the idea that Ghana was founded solely by Nkrumah. President Akufo-Addo emphasized the collective effort of many leaders in Ghana’s liberation. Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, August 5, Mr Asiedu explained that, “The entity Ghana if you tell me that people contributed to our liberation from colonialism I agree, and their effort should not be discouraged. What I’m saying is that their contribution was towards our liberation, but to the formation of the country Ghana as we see it today, it was Kwame Nkrumah's thinking and we cannot take that away from him, because it is clearly stated.” He noted that by 1951, there were differing opinions on whether to pursue immediate or gradual independence for the Gold Coast. He questioned why the very people who wrote a letter to the British not to grant independence as was being sought by Kwame Nkrumah and wanted what has come to be known as Ghana today to be dismembered into different nations, are suddenly claiming to be founders. Asiedu emphasized the importance of maintaining historical accuracy. “We should not allow anyone to rewrite history. The evidence is clear and well-documented.” He also highlighted that from Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957, to the establishment of the First Republic on July 1, 1960, Nkrumah’s role was undisputed. It was only after the government changed hands in 2017 that attempts to alter historical narratives emerged. “In my view, returning to the established historical record is the best course of action. The evidence is clear: Ghana as we know it today is the result of Nkrumah’s vision. Without it, the identity of the nation could have been very different,” Asiedu concluded.

            "Summary: A former Senior Governance Advisor at the United Nations, Professor Baffour Agyeman-Duah, has stated that the contributions of Ghana's first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, cannot be understated. According to him, despite personal disagreements with some of Nkrumah's domestic policies, Nkrumah's contributions to Ghana's development merit full recognition. In his 2024 Founders’ Day address on Saturday, August 3, President Akufo-Addo firmly rejected the idea that Ghana was founded by a single individual. The president disagreed with claims that Kwame Nkrumah single-handedly founded Ghana, emphasising the collective efforts of many individuals in the independence struggle. While acknowledging Nkrumah's undeniable contribution, he stressed that Nkrumah was not the sole architect of Ghana's independence. Speaking on the JoyNews AM show, Professor Agyeman-Duah said, “No matter what you say, Nkrumah stands tall in our politics, and nobody can belittle his accomplishment. \"Even though personally as I speak, there were certain domestic policies that I never liked and still don’t like, but still, even after discounting all those negativities, Nkrumah is a person that deserves the fullest recognition. After all, he (Nkrumah) was the man of the millennium, and that in itself says it all.\" Prof Agyeman-Duah stated that while several people contributed intellectually to the founding of Ghana, it was Kwame Nkrumah alone who shaped the nation's ideological and emotional aspects. He emphasised that understanding who founded Ghana requires acknowledging Nkrumah's ideological and emotional contributions while also recognising the significant role of the UGCC [United Gold Coast Convention]. “After all, they [UGCC] brought Nkrumah; perhaps even if they had not brought him, he was going to come himself. Yet he was brought down to help them achieve independence. How can you take that away?” he quizzed.\n",

            "Summary: The flagbearer of Yellow Ghana, Samuel Apea-Danquah, says that the goals of President John Mahama and the NDC's 24-hour economy policy can be more effectively achieved through two of Yellow Ghana's proposed Labour Reforms. According to him, these reforms, detailed on Page 83 of their manifesto, involve setting maximum working hours and implementing a freeze on overtime. Mr Apea-Danquah believes that these measures will promote sustainable job creation and economic stability without the drawbacks associated with the 24-hour economy. In a Facebook post by Yellow Ghana, it stated that “Maximum Working Hours: By setting a cap on the number of working hours per week, we ensure that employees are not overworked and have a balanced life. This policy promotes better health, higher productivity, and a more motivated workforce. It also encourages businesses to hire more employees to meet their operational needs, thereby creating more jobs. Mr  Apea-Danquah noted that “Freeze on Overtime: Implementing a freeze on overtime prevents the exploitation of workers and ensures that businesses do not rely on excessive overtime to meet their targets. This policy promotes the hiring of additional staff, spreading employment opportunities more evenly, and reducing unemployment rates.” It added that Yellow Ghana's labour reforms involve increasing the minimum wage to $3.55 per day, with automatic adjustments. Mr  Apea-Danquah said this initiative aims to ensure that workers receive a living wage, securing a decent standard of living. The statement said by focusing on fair wages, the party seeks to not only enhance citizens' quality of life but also boost economic growth through greater consumer spending. The statement stressed that the party's objective is not just to create jobs for statistical purposes but to ensure these jobs provide wages that guarantee a decent standard of living. “Yellow Ghana’s approach is grounded in practicality and fairness, aiming to create a robust economy where every citizen can thrive. \"In conclusion, the goals of the NDC's 24-hour economy policy can be achieved more effectively and sustainably through Yellow Ghana’s Labour Reforms. We offer a balanced and realistic approach that respects the well-being of our workforce and promotes genuine economic growth. Ghana deserves better, and Yellow Ghana is committed to delivering policies that truly benefit our people.”\n",

            "Summary: By: Nana Kwame Bediako Algeria’s 17-year-old gymnast, Kaylia Nemour, has made history at the Paris 2024 Olympics by winning a gold medal in the women’s gymnastics. This extraordinary achievement marks the first-ever Olympic gymnastics medal for Africa, bringing immense pride to her home country and the continent at large. Competing against some of the world’s best athletes, Nemour showcased her exceptional skills and determination, earning top scores and capturing the judges’ attention. The young gymnast’s routines were filled with precision, grace, and a level of difficulty that set her apart from her competitors. Nemour’s victory is not only a personal triumph but also a significant milestone for African gymnastics. Historically, the sport has been dominated by athletes from countries with more established gymnastics programs. Nemour’s success is expected to inspire a new generation of gymnasts across Africa, proving that excellence in gymnastics is achievable regardless of geographic or economic barriers. As Africa and the world at large applaud Kaylia Nemour’s historic win, her story will undoubtedly spark curiosity and interest in gymnastics within Africa and beyond. Her gold medal victory at the Paris 2024 Olympics will be remembered as a groundbreaking moment.

            "Summary: By: Michael Okuley Ghana’s sprint pair Benjamin Azamati and Abdul Rasheed Saminu have missed the 100m final place in the ongoing Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The duo made a blistering run in the semis to give hope for the final with decent times. Benjamin Azamati who started the day’s race in Heat 1 lane 3 clocked a time of 10.17 to finish 9th which hindered his progress to the finals. Jamaica’s Seville Oblique won the race with a time of 9.81 with the second position going to America’s Lyles Noah with a time of 9.83. Despite becoming the first Ghanaian to make an Olympic Games semi-finals, Benjamin Azamati expresses disappointment over his inability to make the final cut. “One of the best races this season and one of my worst but I can’t complain. I have worked hard to get here and finishing at the semis is good for me. I couldn’t put up a good race but it’s still a learning process.” “The best way is not to give up. I’m getting back to training hard for the subsequent championships. I have mastered the art of controlling my emotions in the block, which has been the greatest lesson”. Debutant Abdul Rasheed Saminu also made a time of 10.05 in Heat 3 to pick the 7th position in the race. The 26-year-old’s record beats Africa champion Ferdinand Omanyala. The Heat race was won by Thompson Kishane with 9.80 and the 9.85 made by America’s Kelly Fred won him the second position and his seasonal best feat. “It’s a great experience as a young Olympian for the next chapter. I didn’t get the quick start as I wanted but I recovered very well. This experience is what I will cherish forever. We are going to work hard for Ghaan in the next competitions”.

            "Summary: Quiet manoeuvres in the vast voter enclave of the Ashanti Region have set the tone for a potential long drawn battle as Ghana’s two main political parties battle it out for a chunk of what is available in the 2024 general election. The governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) will unveil a campaign team for the region this weekend, while the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) says its strategy for the region is under wraps, setting the stage for the upcoming shadow boxing for votes in the NPP’s backyard. This is the stronghold of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), where the party has always secured 70 per cent of the votes since 2000. The remainder is left for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the combined effort of all other minority parties sharing the votes in the region. The NPP and the opposition NDC are locked in a fierce contest for votes, each seeking to tip the scales in its favour. In the 2020 elections, the NPP solidified its grip on the region, securing 1,795,824 votes, representing 74.14 per cent of the votes, while the NDC garnered 653,149 votes, representing 26.08 per cent of the votes, leaving the two parties separated by 1,142,675 votes. This was a notable improvement for the NDC from its 2016 performance, where the party garnered 23.03 per cent of the votes. Data analysis shows that anytime the NPP is able to cross the 75 per cent votes in Ashanti Region, it wins the national election. The NDC, which has alternated occupancy of the nation’s seat of government with the NPP in all of the 32 years of the Fourth Republic, comes to the table with a core support base that has remained faithful over the years. It is that group of voters that the NPP targets, as the party’s presumptive vice-presidential candidate, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, stated at his unveiling in Kumasi on July 9, this year. Ambitious target The NPP’s running mate made the clarion call to supporters to deliver 85 per cent of the votes in the region to the party in December during his July 9 unveiling in his constituency. The party itself has been more modest, setting its sights on securing 80 per cent of the votes in the region to cement its dominance. The NPP’s ambitious target is driven by its desire to “break the eight”, a reference to the two-term ruling cycles the NPP and the NDC have enjoyed in the Fourth Republic. The NPP’s dominance in the region is rooted in its historical legacy and cultural affinity. The National Organiser of the party, Henry Nana Boakye, aka Nana B, told the Daily Graphic that: “We are unveiling a campaign team for the region on August 4, to prosecute our campaign for the region and to ensure that we achieve the 80 per cent or higher votes from the region”. Achieving the audacious target requires marshalling all arsenal, including human, financial and logistical resources, to douse the possibility of voter apathy among a population that fetches the party its biggest votes in national polls. The region is crucial for both the NPP and the NDC due to its large electorate and historical voting patterns. The main opposition party, the NDC, is hoping to peel off some of the NPP’s support by building on its growing momentum, aiming to achieve 30 per cent or more of the votes in the region. General Secretary of the party, Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, also told the Daily Graphic that he was hoping that the party’s plans for the region would help the opposition party to achieve the 30 per cent it had set for the region. He, however, declined to mention the party’s strategies for the region. “We have a laser focused eye on the Ashanti Region and will deploy all available resources to ensure that we achieve the 30 per cent votes or more from the region,” he said. For the NDC, a shift in voter sentiments can potentially boost the party’s chances in the region. Political scientists But political scientists say if the NDC can build on its past results and exceed 30 per cent of the votes in Ashanti Region, all things being equal, it could boost the party’s chances of regaining power, while an 80 per cent or more votes in Ashanti Region for the NPP could keep the ruling party in the Jubilee House.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/africa/timbuktu-institute/2024/\n",
            "Summary: As part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2020-2025, and in particular Axis 3 on “Promoting a culture of peace through an educational approach and the enhancement of endogenous resources, cultural heritage, and the strengthening of resilience”, the Timbuktu Institute-African Center for Peace Studies is continuing the “Resilience at the borders” initiative launched with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation a few years ago. The predominantly security-based approach and vulnerabilities in border areas are very often highlighted to the detriment of interactions, which are captured rarely by traditional indicators, research and field studies. The “Living on the border: challenges or opportunities” project, initiated by the Timbuktu Institute with the support of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, has made possible, through exchanges with young people, to discover, according to Bakary Sambe, that “some areas that benefit from very few development initiatives are brimming with potential, especially in terms of building and resilience strengthening to conflict and violent extremism”. The discussions and recommendations highlighted a strong demand for capacity-building and the promotion of youth and female leadership in order to an impetus to a commitment to social cohesion and conflict prevention, in all, especially in these very strategic areas of certain countries in terms of security and stability. All the more so, these areas are often covered by extremist groups from countries that share a historical and cultural continuum with Senegal’s border areas. As part of Axis 3 of its Strategic Plan 2020-2025 on “Promoting a culture of peace through an educational approach and the enhancement of endogenous resources, cultural heritage and strengthening resilience”, the Timbuktu Institute -African Center For Peace Studies- is pursuing the “Resilience at the borders” initiative, with Saint-Louis, Matam and Tambacoun chosenda as pilot sites. These areas, known for their sensitivity, should be given priority in peacebuilding and resilience-building initiatives as part of a preventive approach and to capitalise on the endogenous levers of resilience. The dialogue sessions will begin with speeches by the Regional Director of the Timbuktu Institute and the Representative of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. After the official opening by the Governor of the region or his representative, there will be an inaugural session on the “Regional security situation and the challenges of strengthening community resilience: complementary roles of the State and local populations”, by Dr. Bakary Sambe. This will be followed by a series of presentations on topics such as “Women and conflict, the role of women in Senegalese culture” and “Young people and radicalisation in border areas: risks and resilience factors”. Perceptions of the conflict and of the relationship between the Defence and Security Forces and the population will be discussed at length during the group work, and the strategic formulated recommendations will be presented before the debriefing and closure of the session. The recommendations will be shared with the national authorities as part of the contribution to the development and improvement of the frameworks for action adopted by the State of Senegal and its partners.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/commentary/paternity-leave/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Dr. Kofi Amponsah Bediako, Development Analyst Child upbringing does not depend on only one person but on both parents, who bring the child into the world. For biological reasons, we tend to leave the care of the baby for the mother when it comes to breastfeeding, bathing the baby, and other activities that make the baby happy, lively, and healthy. However, child upkeep, care or upbringing is not only the responsibility of the mother but the father as well. When it comes to babysitting, cuddling, singing to the baby and carrying him or her around, among others, fathers can also take up that role. Each of the parents is also expected to support the other when tiredness sets in, when for instance, a baby is awake deep into the night and one is expected to stay awake caring for the child. Since both parents are expected to play a crucial role in bringing up the child, it is necessary to arrange for a period for the father to support the efforts of the mother. It is against this backdrop that the introduction of a paternity leave to create the room for fathers to support the care of the baby is relevant. During the 2024 mid-year Budget Review, the Minister for Finance announced a type of leave, known as paternity leave, to help fathers assist mothers in caring for the newly born. On the face of it, this may not be seen as something of socio-economic value. However, when carefully examined, it will be clear that it contributes to the socio-economic welfare of a newly born child, the nuclear family, as well as the country. This explains why paternity leave is good and important for the family, society, and the nation. For fathers to qualify, employees must provide proof of birth or adoption to their employers. Upon approval, the employers are required to grant a minimum of five days of paternity leave, effective from the specified date in the application. However, a worker cannot be granted more than one paternity leave within a 24-month period. Human growth and development is influenced by many factors such as genetic inheritance, hormonal balance, nutrition, overall health status, and neurological development. All these factors are important, but early care after a baby is born should never be compromised under any circumstance. There is a need to ensure that this scheme of leave is well organised and implemented to achieve the maximum result if it is introduced. More stories here Your email address will not be published.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/news/business/gold-ghana-exports/2024/\n",
            "Summary: Gold exports jumped to a record high in the first half of 2024. According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission, Mr Martin Ayisi, out of the total exports of US$9.2 billion for the first half of 2024, gold alone accounted for 54% of the total exports, which amounted to US$ 5 billion. This, he said, was the result of the surge in gold prices, especially in the second quarter of 2024, and the increase in production from both small- and large-scale operations. The gold price averaged a record $2 338 an ounce in the second quarter, 18% higher year-on-year and 13% higher quarter-on-quarter. The average price of gold for the month of July is about US$2396 an ounce. Gold reached a new record of US$2482 an ounce on 17 July 2024. Mr. Ayisi has predicted that if the price of gold stays around the average for the month of July or the second quarter, then the full-year outlook for gold will hit US$10 billion or more. The Chief Executive Officer noted that the exports from small-scale mining for the first half of this year is about US$ 1.7 billion and accounted for about 36% of the gold exported by mid-year. He predicted that, on the back of the record price, exports from small scale may be more than US$ 3 billion by the end of 2024. According to Mr. Ayisi revenue from gold goes to reinforce the fact that the mining sector remains the pillar of Ghana’s economy. He, however, indicated that the real benefits of mining to the economy lie in the value addition. He cited the cases of lithium, bauxite, and manganese, and even the local refinery of gold. He was particularly happy about manganese and the strong policy of the Government on value addition. Explaining further, Ghana Manganese Company shall construct a 450-million-dollar refinery to refine manganese ore. This will upgrade the grade from 27 to 40 percent, create an additional 350 jobs, and contribute to revenue. The CEO also referred to the new measures that have been put in place in the area of local content and local participation to ensure that over US$ 2 billion dollars that are spent by the mining companies on local supplies and services are undertaken by Ghanaians. He further mentioned the efforts being made by the Government to ensure the mining companies list on the Ghana Stock Exchange to raise capital for mining projects and lauded the work of the Minerals Income Investment Fund to take equity stakes in mines, all to enhance state and Ghanaian participation in the mining sector. Mr Ayisi called for better environmental management of small-scale mining operations, which is carried out in about 12 regions in Ghana and support about three million livelihoods to ensure the operations do not damage the environment.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/news/politics/npp-health-walk/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Mercy Darko Thousands of NPP supporters and celebrities joined the Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, and the Parliamentary Candidate for the Akuapem North Constituency, Sammi Awuku, for the ”Ofie Walk” from Mamfe to Mampong Akuapem in the Eastern Region. The walk was part of the official campaign launch of NPP’s Parliamentary Candidate of the Akuapem North Constituency, Sammy Awuku. Dr. Bawumia charged the party supporters to move to all corners of the constituency to propagate the message of the NPP. The Ofie Walk is an initiative by the Parliamentary Candidate of the NPP for Akuapem North Constituency in the Eastern Region. It is to energise and mobilise the support base of the NPP in the Constituency and galvanise them for the campaign activities in the Constituency ahead the 2024 general elections.

The Ofie walk started at Manfe, through Amanokrom, Abotakyi, and ended at Mampong. The common message for the walk was ”It Is Possible”. At Mampong, several leaders addressed the supporters gathered at the end of the walk. The message was simple: ”Move from house to sell the good news of the government to the people.” The Presidential Candidate of the NPP, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, told the party supporters that his policies are transformational for Ghana’s future. “Our competitors always see impossibilities, but we say it is possible. I believe the country can achieve whatever it sets its mind to do.” Dr. Bawumia charged the party supporters to move to homes, nooks and cranny to sell the party’s campaign message to Ghanaians. “Whatever the western world has achieved, can also be replicated in Ghana and Africa as a whole. It is possible.” The Member of Parliament for the Akuapem North Constituency. Sammy Awuku, told the supporters to gird up their loins and work until victory is won. “The Free SHS policy was described as an impossible mission by the opposition, but today they claim they are the ones who implemented it,” he noted. Mr Awuku retorted, “Ghana has a future in Dr Mahamudu Bawumia. The elections ahead of us is an election between Ghana’s future and its past.” The Flagbearer of the NPP, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, is in the Eastern Region as part of his constituency-focused nationwide campaign tour.

            "Summary: The all-female brass bands, a group of Ada women residing either in the community or elsewhere, who played brass band with skill, took centre stage at the 2024 Asafotufiami Festival on Saturday with their splendid performances. The masterly drumming of the women sparked ecstasy among the crowd, who could not help but to sway their bodies and tap their feet to the beats amidst applause. Mrs Elizabeth Tete Mensah, one of the ladies from Accra Number One Branch Band, said the all-female brass band had been a special feature of the Asafotufiami over the years. It was to ignite joy and sustain people’s interest during the festival, noted as one of the activities that mostly drew people to the celebration, she said. Mrs Mensah said she was initiated into the group by her mother and had played for over 30 years, adding that she had also introduced her children into it. Mr Alexandra Katey Nartey, the Financial Secretary, Takoradi Branch Band, said drumming had been a male-dominated art, but the Ada female indigenes had been trained to break the norm. The women’s presence in the group gave it a different dimension, they were phenomenal and captivated the crowd, while promoting women’s participation in brass band music, he said. Previously, he said the band constituted only the elderly in society, but as time went by, they decided to involve the youth to tap into their energy and creativity in playing. “The youth were also added as a way of getting them to come back to their roots and contribute to their community’s development…” he said. “I was born in Kumasi; initially I was not comfortable visiting my hometown. It took some courage, and upon coming, I’ve realised that my knowledge regarding our traditions has improved and I’m speaking our language better.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/fashion-and-lifestyle/smoothies/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Mary Agyepomah-Kissi & Kafui Dey Smoothies are more than just a delicious treat or a quick snack. They offer a multitude of health benefits that can help boost your immune system and improve your overall well-being. On the #GTVBreakfast show this morning, Thelma Tackie interviewed two experts—Gracia Helarie Fraikue, a dietician, and Pearlvis Sefakor Tornu, an entrepreneur from Green Café—who shared their insights on the health benefits of smoothies. Let’s delve into what they had to say about the power of these blended wonders. The Nutritional Powerhouse of Smoothies Gracia Helarie Fraikue emphasized that smoothies are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. “Smoothies aid in digestion, improve skin health, and help in weight management,” she noted. By choosing the right ingredients, you can tailor your smoothie to meet specific health goals. Weight Management Made Easy Smoothies can be a great tool for weight management. According to Gracia, fruits like avocados and bananas are ideal for those looking to gain weight, while berries and citrus fruits are perfect for weight loss. However, portion control is crucial. “The quantity of fruits you take is a factor in either gaining or losing weight,” she explained. Nutrient-Rich and Balanced A well-made smoothie is a nutritional powerhouse, offering vitamins A, C, and E, fiber, potassium, and magnesium. These nutrients are vital for maintaining good health and supporting bodily functions. Regulating Sugar Levels Gracia pointed out that while smoothies can help regulate sugar levels, it’s essential to choose fruits with a low glycemic index. Diabetic patients, for example, should avoid high-sugar fruits like pineapples and watermelons. Beyond Fruits: The Power of Vegetables Vegetables can also be incorporated into smoothies, enhancing their nutritional value. Ingredients like spinach, kale, and carrots not only add a nutrient boost but also complement the flavors of fruits. Boosting Smoothie Benefits To maximize the health benefits of smoothies, Gracia recommended adding ingredients like turmeric, ginger, and honey. These not only enhance the taste but also provide anti-inflammatory properties that contribute to better skin and overall health. Meal Replacement or Supplement? Smoothies can be a meal replacement if they contain a balanced mix of nutrients. However, Gracia cautioned against forgoing main meals entirely in an attempt to lose weight. A smoothie should complement your diet, not replace it. Smoothies for Athletes Athletes often consume smoothies for pre- and post-workout nutrition. Pre-workout smoothies provide the energy needed for exercise, while post-workout smoothies aid in muscle recovery and replenishment of lost nutrients. Avoiding Common Mistakes Gracia highlighted some common mistakes to avoid when making smoothies, such as adding too much sugar or high-calorie ingredients. It’s important to maintain a balance of fruits, vegetables, and protein sources. Anti-Aging Smoothies Certain smoothies can support anti-aging. Ingredients like turmeric, carrots, and ginger promote healthy skin and can help you look and feel younger. Pearlvis Sefakor Tornu’s Smoothie Secrets Pearlvis Sefakor Tornu from Green Café shared her expertise on creating popular smoothie combinations. She prepared a green smoothie made with spinach, kale, bananas, and honey, a customer favorite for its delicious taste and nutritional benefits. Ensuring Consistency and Catering to Dietary Needs Pearlvis emphasized the importance of using fresh, high-quality ingredients and maintaining precise measurements for consistency. She also highlighted the café’s ability to customize smoothies to meet various dietary needs, including vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free options. Popular Choices and Recommendations The green smoothie and berry blast are top choices among customers, loved for their refreshing taste and health benefits. Pearlvis also shared that they consider customers’ health goals, dietary restrictions, and personal preferences when recommending smoothies.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/news/misinformation-2/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Seli Baisie As Ghana approaches its 2024 elections, concerns over the spread of misinformation and disinformation have intensified. These falsehoods are increasingly harming communities, particularly in developing African countries like Ghana, where digital space and internet penetration are being exploited to create clickbait stories for personal gain. The media, being the fourth estate, plays a critical role in maintaining democracy by ensuring that accurate information reaches the public. Fact-checking is the process of verifying information to ensure it is accurate and true. This involves comparing facts against reliable sources to confirm their correctness. These channels can quickly amplify misinformation, making it crucial to verify information from reliable sources before believing or sharing it. Using these tools can help journalists verify the authenticity of images, ensuring they are not misled by altered or out-of-context visuals.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/general/lifestyle-and-its-diseases/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Angela Adu-Asomaning According to the World Health Organization, non-communicable diseases of which lifestyle diseases are a part, claim many lives annually, which is over 70% of all deaths across the globe. Of these, over 15 million deaths occur among people in the age band of 30 to 69 years. Lifestyle diseases include atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke; obesity,type 2 diabetes, and diseases associated with smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. Reports say, diabetes, cancer, heart and respiratory diseases will be the leading killers by 2030 if care is not taken to contain them. Heart disease, one of the lifestyle diseases, has remained the leading cause of death at the global level for the last 20 years and it is now killing more people than ever before. The number of deaths from heart disease increased by more than two million since 2000, to nearly nine million in 2019. Heart disease now represents 16% of total deaths from all causes. Deaths from diabetes- another lifestyle disease, increased by 70% globally between 2000 and 2019, with an 80% rise in deaths among males. Diabetes mellitus, cancers and cardiovascular conditions have been identified as the three fatal lifestyle diseases wreaking havoc to many lives. Senior Lecturer and Head of Department of Pathology at the University of Ghana Medical School, Dr Afua Abrahams, says modifiable, non-modifiable and metabolic reasons are the major contributory factors to these lifestyle diseases. Dr Abrahams who also doubles as a Senior Pathologist at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, however said, ”though these diseases are not curable for now, they can be managed or prevented”. She emphasised the importance of adopting healthy lifestyles to combat these diseases. She says there is the need to be active, exercise regularly and eat well balanced meals, avoid addictive things like alcohol and tobacco as well as the need to minimise anger and have good sleep. A Nursing Officer at the Kekeli Hospital in Accra, Blaise Ackom says there is a need to sensitize people on the effects of tobacco smoking, sniffing of glue and other narcotic drugs, especially, among young people. He said intensive education is required to raise awareness on the dire consequences of substance abuse on the human body. He emphasized the need to reduce the intake of junk, oily and fatty foods and avoid red meat, and rather opt for fruits and vegetables. Health is wealth and this common saying holds a lot of weight because there is truth behind it. As a people, we need to make healthy food choices, avoid ultra-processed foods. watch our blood pressure, check our cholesterol levels, watch our body mass, manage our blood sugar levels, quit smoking, go for regular check-ups and adopt regular physical exercise as a lifestyle.

            "Title: Book Review: Revolution and Democracy in Ghana: The Politics of Jerry Rawlings\n",
            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/features/book-jerry-rawlings/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Bright Philip Donkor My journey into the author’s world began with an unexpected digital encounter—a riveting article titled “Development Challenges in an Election Year.” This piece, an exploration of political and developmental dynamics, not only piqued my interest but also paved the way for a meaningful relationship with the author. Through his insightful analysis and engaging narrative, he has transformed from a distant writer into a friend and mentor, offering profound insights into the tumultuous and transformative era of Jerry Rawlings’ rule. In the kaleidoscopic world of Ghanaian politics, where the hues of history and power intertwine in a complex dance, I would be remiss if I did not explore the revolutionary spirit and democratic shifts that defined the era, guided by an author whose intellectual curiosity and personal connection to the subject matter deepen our understanding of Ghana’s political landscape. Professor Jeffrey Haynes is an Emeritus Professor of Politics at London Metropolitan University (London Met), actively shaping discourse on African politics through his scholarly work, guidance on research agendas, and public engagement with the continent’s diverse political landscapes. He specialises in political science, with a focus on political theory, international relations, and comparative politics. His research includes topics such as religion and politics, global governance, and development. Professor Haynes’s deep interest in Ghanaian politics led him to write his PhD thesis on “Rawlings and the Politics of Development Policy in Ghana, 1979-1986,” which he completed between 1984 and 1988. His work is driven by an interest in the politics of underdevelopment under Flt. Lt. Jerry John Rawlings’ regime. This book seeks to challenge simplistic portrayals of leadership and examine the complex interactions between state institutions, civil society, public welfare, and global influences. Personal reflections Upon my first reading of the review copy during my leisure time, I knew it had a vast potential for intellectual trouble. It is that very fact that makes it such a valuable and worthwhile publication. For me, reading the book is just like a rare breed of sweet wine whose taste still lingers in the mouth and makes the taste buds wanting more. The book effectively addresses many of the questions we have pondered about Rawlings’ political ideology, the impact of his governance on Ghanaian democracy, and how his rule influenced the country’s political institutions and policies. Though this is not a book written by Rawlings himself, it illuminates the Rawlings era and democratisation in a manner unmatched by other works. The publication of this book is a significant event. Despite the vibrancy of Rawlings’ nearly two decades of rule, that period remains relatively opaque in our history. And I dare say reading the book has profoundly deepened my understanding of Ghanaian politics. Before diving into this text, my perspective on Rawlings was largely shaped by popular narratives and media portrayals. The author’s meticulous research and nuanced analysis have provided me with a richer, more complex view of Rawlings’ impact. I came to appreciate not only the ideological shifts during Rawlings’ tenure but also the intricate interplay between revolutionary fervor and the pragmatic challenges of governance. Prof. Haynes’ exploration of controversial aspects, such as the murder of judges and economic reforms, challenged my previously simplistic views. The detailed examination of how Rawlings’ regime navigated international pressures and internal power struggles offered new insights into the broader political context of the time. The book has helped me understand the legacy of Rawlings’ policies, particularly their role in shaping Ghana’s transition towards a more democratic and market-oriented society. When Rawlings passed away on November 12, 2020, I was initially numb with disbelief. However, such a day was inevitable. He has left the battlefield he once conquered, and we can now reflect on his legacy and find appropriate words to eulogize him. Beginning the revolution at the age of 32 serves as a testament to his role as a model for young revolutionaries. Those times were filled with mixed emotions—memorable and controversial—giving rise to various theories and rumors about power struggles, personality clashes, and policy challenges in both the PNDC and Rawlings’ NDC administrations. The author says in the preface that _“The book has four objectives. First, I seek to contextualise Rawlings’ initial revolutionary populism in contemporaneous radical military interventions in Africa. The second is to outline the characteristics and political consequences of Rawlings’ revolutionary populism and authoritarian populism which replaced it. The third is to examine the return to multi-party democracy in late 1992 and the following 10 years of Rawlings rule as elected president. The fourth objective is to assess Rawlings political legacy in Ghana following his death in November 2020.”_ Scope Despite the book’s succinctly defined scope, it offers more than what its author suggests. Three significant aspects make this book a historic contribution to our understanding of recent developments in our country. The first is the role played by Rawlings and some of his closest associates in shaping a revolutionary period that began without a clear roadmap. Jerry John Rawlings is often seen as both an enigma and a contradiction. That is why books on him will evoke interest and attract readership. From his abortive May 15 infantile coup attempt, through June 4 to December 31, and the attempted coup by Lance Corporal Giwa and blood cousin Captain Courage Quarshigah’s arrest, Rawlings has been a subject that titillates scholarship and research. That is why the book is a must-read, not only for academicians, historians, and researchers, but also for ordinary citizens and, particularly, the youth who may take our democratic journey and experience for granted. Very well researched and scripted, the writer does a tidy work by digging into nearly all available material on Jerry Rawlings, including talking to persons close to him and even those who he worked but fell apart with his chequered career as three-time Head of State of Ghana from 1979 through 1981 to 1992 and into 2000. Strengths / weaknesses The words of Prof. Haynes are strong because he provides a thorough analysis of Rawlings’ leadership, from his revolutionary beginnings to his role in establishing multi-party democracy. The book’s exploration of both political and economic dimensions of Rawlings’ tenure is commendable. The book situates Rawlings’ leadership within the broader context of African politics, offering valuable insights into the regional and international influences that shaped his policies. Prof. Haynes’ use of extensive interviews and archival materials adds significant depth to his analysis, presenting a well-rounded view of the political and economic challenges faced during Rawlings’ regime. As with any scholarly work, there is a risk of inherent bias, especially given that Prof. Haynes has a long-standing academic interest in African politics. While the book aims for objectivity, there may be an unconscious inclination to emphasize certain aspects of Rawlings’ leadership while downplaying others. Eccentric and controversial elements But the author, who would also add notes to his rich scholarly work, was meticulous and courageous enough to investigate controversial clansmen of Jerry Rawlings such as Prof Kofi Awoonor and others who had an ethnicity agenda that was remotely connected with the plot to plan and execute a coup after lawful elections had been held and a government in place in December 1981. Akata Poree, Adabuga, Courage Quarshigah, Kojo and Tsatsu Tsikata all find space in this rich chronicle of events from Jerry Rawlings and his compulsive march into a democracy that was forced on him and his junta by global development agencies. Such background concerns also included public and global apprehensions about a potential Rawlings dynasty and the influence of the United States. A notable event was President Bill Clinton’s visit to Ghana in 1998, during which he emphasised the importance of democratic principles, and allegedly cautioned Rawlings against deciding to foist himself on the people for a third constitutional term. Murder of the judges, outburst of professional associations The piece is further enriched by Prof. Jeffery Haynes’ analysis of the murder of the judges and its political fallout on the junta, including the outrage directed at Kojo Tsikata and Amartey, who were made scapegoats. It also examines how the junta attempted to gain credibility by creating Civil and Workers Defence Committees, aiming to present itself as inclusive and democratic. The pressure on the junta to reform or face removal, driven by the public’s anger as Rawlings himself described it, added to the junta’s insecurity. This environment contributed to the dissatisfaction among military officers like Alidu Giwa, who, feeling sidelined, attempted a countercoup. The fact that his own investigative team and Committee of Inquiry placed the blame for the murders squarely on Kojo Tsikata led to a loss of credibility among the political, middle class, and professional bodies and some safety needed in illiterate, vulnerable, docile citizens. Economic reforms and press freedom The author was spot on when he notes that it was at this critical point that the regime decided to open up to the West and its agencies in agreeing to economic reform programmes after being turned down by the former USSR or Soviet Union, which failed to buy proposal on reforms submitted by Ghana, with Tsatsu Tsikata and Kwesi Botchwey leading the team to Moscow. In this objective treatise, the author also notes success stories in implementing the World Bank and IMF Ghana Country Programmes that would eventually thaw the socialist nonsense and force the country closer to good governance and constitutionality codes. With the liberalised environment, the previously suppressed independent media became a channel for advocating constitutional rule—a tide that the junta had difficulty managing, despite its use of the antedated Criminal Libel Law intended to intimidate journalists. Eventually, when it led to funding a crony broadcast network, the junta unwittingly began opening the floodgates for a revolution in freedom of the press. This shift diminished its ability to use institutions like the Media Commission and Electoral Commission, for instance, in pushing its propaganda and skewing elections. Interestingly, it turned out according to this book that, the people who had become nostalgic for democratic governance began creating political clubs, following in the steps of the junta, which had created the December 31st Women’s Movement, besides the CDRs and WDCs, and waiting for the day the pressure on the regime to lift the ban on politics, to constitutionally fight Jerry Rawlings and his junta. ‘Revolution and Democracy in Ghana: The Politics of Jerry Rawlings’ stands out as a crucial work for anyone interested in the evolution of Ghanaian politics. The author  provides a thorough examination of Jerry Rawlings’ impact on the country’s democratic development, combining rigorous research with insightful analysis. The book’s exploration of Rawlings’ transformative leadership, controversial policies, and the political shifts of his era offers valuable perspectives that deepen our understanding of Ghana’s political landscape. This masterpiece is recommended to all segments of the population, including the business community, academia, and politicians. More stories here Your email address will not be published.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/general/founders-day-akufo-addo/2024/\n",
            "Summary: By Rachel Kakraba President Akufo-Addo has encouraged Ghanaians to recommit to the principles of democracy, as a reverence to sacrifices made by Ghana’s forebears. He said citizens must solidify the country’s democratic gains by contributing to making independent institutions more robust and resilient. In a Founders’ Day broadcast, President Akufo-Addo also asked Ghanaians to demonstrate a high sense of patriotism and be tolerant of divergent views. “We should continue to advocate national unity and social cohesion.  Our diversity is one of our greatest assets, and we should work to ensure that every Ghanaian feels included and valued.” President Akufo Addo, also assured of his government’s commitment to a transparent, free and fair election in December. He said the Vigilantism and Related Offences Law will be enforced strictly to maintain peace in Ghana, before, during and after the general election. “The integrity of our electoral process is paramount, and we will take all necessary steps to secure it. The law against vigilantism will be strictly applied without fear or favour, ensuring that peace and order are maintained throughout the electoral period, enabling the Ghanaian people to make their choice free of intimidation and violence.” President Akufo Addo also said the process of building strong professional security services will be intensified to guarantee law and order and the stability of the nation and to guard the nation against external threats, especially terrorist insurgency that has engulfed the Sahelian region. In 2019, Parliament passed a law establishing August 4 as Founders’ Day to honour the collective efforts of those who contributed to Ghana’s independence struggle, while designating September 21 as Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Day.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/general-news/ndc-bono/2024/\n",
            "Summary: The Bono Regional Youth Wing of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has intensified the electioneering, propagating the economic policies of the party to the voter population, particularly first-time voters at the grassroots. Mr Richard Nkwanayana, a member of the Media and Outreach of the Youth Wing, said it was imperative for the party to reach out to and sensitise the electorate to understand the policies of the NDC to make informed decisions on December 7. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in Sunyani on Friday, Mr Nkwanayana said the wing was reaching out to market women and traders in general as well as ‘ghetto boys’, to sensitise them on the ideologies and philosophies of the NDC. Describing the party’s 24-hour economy as a realistic intervention, he said it was imperative for the party to explain the policy to the electorate for better understanding to clearly decide and vote for the NDC. Besides the 24-hour economy, Mr Nkwanayana said the electorate also ought to understand the NDC’s proposed National Apprenticeship Programme (NAP), and the National Women’s Bank (NWB), policies. The implementation of the NAP and the NWB would provide employable skills training to young people and provide interest-free loans to market women and traders to establish or expand their economic activities, respectively. Mr Nkwanayana expressed concern over the growing graduate and youth unemployment, economic hardship as well as increase in prices of basic food items and other commodities in the country, which had worsened the economic burdens of the populace. He said the signs were clear that Ghanaians were dissatisfied and had lost faith in the President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo-led Government, hence the NDC ought to propagate its intentions and economic policies to the masses to give them hope. “That is why the media and outreach unit of the Youth Wing has taken the responsibility to reach out to all the 12 Constituencies to interact with and propagate the ideals and economic policies of the NDC to the voter population,” Mr Nkwanayana stated. “We have intensified the electioneering and seriously reached out to all marketplaces, ghettos, and all corners of the constituencies of our region to make the masses understand the sound economic policies and social interventions of the next NDC government under former President John Dramani Mahama.” Mr Nkwanayana advised the electorate not to vote blindly when they go to the polls on December 7 and be guided by the economic conditions they faced and vote for the NDC to win and alleviate their plight.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/news/politics/voters-kadjebi-register/2024/\n",
            "Summary: The Kadjebi District Office of the Electoral Commission (EC) in the Oti Region has registered 68 voters as of Friday, August 2, 2024. On the first day of the exercise on Thursday, August 1, 15 voters were registered, with day two registering 53, the EC said. Mr Emmanuel Klu, the Akan NDC Constituency Director of Education, confirmed the figure to the Ghana News Agency but said the exercise encountered a lot of technical hitches on both days, which limited the numbers registered. He appealed to the EC to resolve the problem in order not to disfranchise the would- be voters in the December 7 polls. Mr Bashiru Sabitious Yerizu, the Akan NPP Constituency Director of Research and Elections, said the exercise was going well and hoped things would continue in that orderly manner. GNA’s attempt to speak to the Officials of EC on the technical hitches proved futile. The three-day mop-up voter registration which commenced on Thursday, August 1, would end on Saturday, August 3, 2024. Source: GNA More stories here Your email address will not be published.

            "Link: https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/general/coastline-ghana/2024/\n",
            "Summary: Mr Yiadom Boakye Akoto, the Head of the Coastal Engineering Division of the Ghana Hydrological Authority (GHA), says 290 kilometres of Ghana’s coastline require some protection against erosion to protect lives and property. Ghana has seen a series of coastal erosions along the coast over the years, causing lots of destruction to lives and property at hotspots, affecting the economy and fishing activities of the communities. Mr Akoto noted that Ghana’s 550km approximate coastline is at various levels of vulnerability to such erosion, noting however that one-third of the coastline (180km) is stable with low vulnerability. The remaining 370km of the coastline was at risk and required coastal protection, he said, and that “out of the 370km at risk, approximately 80km of coastline is protected, leaving 290km requiring protection.” “Places like Aboadze, Shama, and Anlo and the coastal stretch from Winneba in the Central Region, Mumford, and places in the Greater Accra like Kokrobite, Dansoman, Tema Newtown, La, Regional Maritime University, and Ningo Prampram, and the eastern stretch from the Lower Volta Delta to Aflao are all in critical areas falling within the 370km,” he said. Mr Akoto revealed this during a Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) media forum and called for urgent steps to be taken, noting that the rising nature of high sea level and coastal erosion was due to climate change. He said that coastal erosion threats were both natural and man-made, mentioning that sand winning was one of the major causes, which had a dire impact on coastal communities in Ghana. “The daily winning of sand at the shores erodes the natural protection of the coast, which is the sand,” he said, adding that having enough sediment along the shore gave the right slope for the wave to break calmly, but the absence of the sand led to erosion. Mr Akoto stressed the need for effective collaboration among stakeholders in addressing the challenges and curbing the menace and called for increased funding for investment in coastal protection. “As it stands, the chance of losing a whole community, holiday resorts, and properties along the coastal area will impose economic hardship on the inhabitants,” he said. He called for an increase in public-private partnerships with developers as the Government could leverage expertise, resources, and funding to implement effective measures. He mentioned that his outfit was concentrating on protecting the remaining 290 kilometres out of the 370 kilometres of coastline under stress, which need urgent attention, and called on the local authorities to enact bye-laws to protect the coast and cautioned the public to desist from practices that endangered the coastlines. The Ghana Hydrological Authority is responsible for the planning, designing, execution, operation, and maintenance of flood control mechanisms, coastal engineering works, drainage improvement works, and operational and applied hydrology in the country.

              "  'news': \"Rating agency, Fitch, has stated that it will assign a Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Ghana once the country reaches an agreement with private creditors on the restructuring of its Foreign Currency - denominated external debt and completes that restructuring process. This it added will be based on a forward-looking assessment of its willingness and capacity to honour its foreign-currency debt. Fitch which recently affirmed Ghana at ‘Restrictive Default’ said the LTLC IDR would be upgraded on reduced liquidity pressures, potentially following the completion of the external debt treatment. For example, restoring macroeconomic stability would significantly lower debt interest costs. Fitch's proprietary Sovereign Rating Model assigns Ghana a score equivalent to a rating of 'B-' on the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR scale. However, per its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee has not utilised the SRM and Qualitative Overlay to explain the ratings. Country Ceiling The Country Ceiling for Ghana is 'B-'. For sovereigns rated 'CCC+' and below, Fitch assumes a starting point of 'CCC+' for determining the Country Ceiling. Fitch's Country Ceiling Model produced a starting point uplift of +0 notch above the IDR.

The GTEC which is the regulator of tertiary institutions in the country has rewritten to the Vice Chancellor to remain in office while all issues about his appointment are being looked at with all stakeholders to bring lasting peace on campus. Prof. Ahmed Abdulai Jinapor, in a letter dated August 2, 2024, directed the Registrar of the University to furnish his office with all relevant documents -concerning the renewal and purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor to avoid interruption in the management of the University. He also directed that all correspondence, court processes and communiques on the matter be forwarded to the Commission for perusal so that the matter can be handled prudently. Background It could be recalled that the name of UCC has been in the news on social media and in the traditional media for the past week following the purported termination of the appointment of the Vice Chancellor of the University by the Council Chairman. This has led to seeming tension among the University Community as various stakeholders keep threatening to embark on protests towards the restoration of the VC back to his post. It is based on this, that GTEC, has ordered the reinstatement of the VC to his position while the matter is handled professionally to ensure free and fair operations on the campus of the university. Seven members of the UCC Governing Council who call themselves “Concerned members of UCC Governing Council” in a letter on 1st August 2024 stated that the issue of termination of appointment was not discussed at their last meeting held on 30th July 2024 and wondered why the Council Chairman can do such a thing. They challenged the Council Chairman to produce any such minutes if there is to confirm his case.Apart from the “Concerned Governing Council” members, the UCC branch of the University Teachers Association (UTAG) and other institutions have all expressed their displeasure with the termination of the VC’s appointment describing it as a sole decision of the Council Chairman.',\n",

His remark is in response to President Akufo-Addo’s recent statement rejecting the notion that Ghana was solely founded by Kwame Nkrumah. Akufo-Addo highlighted that the struggle for Ghana\\'s independence was a collective effort spanning several generations. “I speak to you this evening, rejecting completely, the notion that Ghana was founded by one man. While Kwame Nkrumah’s contributions to our independence are undeniable, it is important to acknowledge for ourselves that respect that the struggle for our nation’s freedom was a collective effort spanning several generations,” President Akufo-Addo said. But Mr Branttie emphasised that Ghana\\'s first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, was instrumental in establishing Ghana as a republic in 1960. In an interview with Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, Mr Branttie acknowledged President Akufo-Addo\\'s view but emphasised Nkrumah\\'s unique role. “There might be historical perspectives that I am unaware of, but the records show that one person, Kwame Nkrumah, was pivotal in advocating for self-government,” he said. Mr Branttie elaborated, noting that Nkrumah was the key figure who initiated the call for self-government, faced imprisonment for his activism, and mobilized national support, compelling the colonial administration to grant self-governance. “Nkrumah demanded immediate self-government and took decisive action. Others did not; some even criticized him. Now, those who opposed him cannot claim a share in his achievements,” he argued. “He [President Akufo-Addo] might have some historical perspective that I don’t know, but what has been recorded there was only one person who created the advocacy for self-government.\"He further stressed the importance of acknowledging historical facts. “People have done those actions and they were recorded, let’s not try to change what is there to satisfy somebody’s failure or family reputation. “What is it is what it is, Nkrumah’s advocacy for immediate self-government was crucial. Without his decisive actions, Ghana might not have become a republic in 1960. His efforts marked a significant turning point in our nation’s history.” Read also : ‘I reject completely the notion that Ghana was founded by Kwame Nkrumah alone’ – Akufo-Addo',\n",

Prof Oquaye claimed that during Dr Kwame Nkrumah’s tenure, there was minimal regard for the protection of human rights.

According to Asiedu, Nkrumah played a pivotal role in shaping Ghana and was crucial in establishing the country as a republic. Mr Asiedu acknowledged that while several others contributed to Ghana's liberation from colonial rule, it was Nkrumah’s ideas and leadership that fundamentally shaped the modern nation. “While many contributed to our fight against colonialism, it was Kwame Nkrumah's vision that defined the Ghana we see today. His contributions were crucial in forming the country as it is now,” Asiedu said. This statement follows President Akufo-Addo’s recent remarks rejecting the idea that Ghana was founded solely by Nkrumah. President Akufo-Addo emphasized the collective effort of many leaders in Ghana’s liberation. Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show on Monday, August 5, Mr Asiedu explained that, “The entity Ghana if you tell me that people contributed to our liberation from colonialism I agree, and their effort should not be discouraged. What I’m saying is that their contribution was towards our liberation, but to the formation of the country Ghana as we see it today, it was Kwame Nkrumah's thinking and we cannot take that away from him, because it is clearly stated.” He noted that by 1951, there were differing opinions on whether to pursue immediate or gradual independence for the Gold Coast. He questioned why the very people who wrote a letter to the British not to grant independence as was being sought by Kwame Nkrumah and wanted what has come to be known as Ghana today to be dismembered into different nations, are suddenly claiming to be founders. Asiedu emphasized the importance of maintaining historical accuracy. “We should not allow anyone to rewrite history. The evidence is clear and well-documented.” He also highlighted that from Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957, to the establishment of the First Republic on July 1, 1960, Nkrumah’s role was undisputed. It was only after the government changed hands in 2017 that attempts to alter historical narratives emerged. “In my view, returning to the established historical record is the best course of action. The evidence is clear: Ghana as we know it today is the result of Nkrumah’s vision. Without it, the identity of the nation could have been very different,” Asiedu concluded.

According to him, these reforms, detailed on Page 83 of their manifesto, involve setting maximum working hours and implementing a freeze on overtime. Mr Apea-Danquah believes that these measures will promote sustainable job creation and economic stability without the drawbacks associated with the 24-hour economy. In a Facebook post by Yellow Ghana, it stated that “Maximum Working Hours: By setting a cap on the number of working hours per week, we ensure that employees are not overworked and have a balanced life. This policy promotes better health, higher productivity, and a more motivated workforce. It also encourages businesses to hire more employees to meet their operational needs, thereby creating more jobs. Mr  Apea-Danquah noted that “Freeze on Overtime: Implementing a freeze on overtime prevents the exploitation of workers and ensures that businesses do not rely on excessive overtime to meet their targets. This policy promotes the hiring of additional staff, spreading employment opportunities more evenly, and reducing unemployment rates.” It added that Yellow Ghana\\'s labour reforms involve increasing the minimum wage to $3.55 per day, with automatic adjustments. Mr  Apea-Danquah said this initiative aims to ensure that workers receive a living wage, securing a decent standard of living. The statement said by focusing on fair wages, the party seeks to not only enhance citizens\\' quality of life but also boost economic growth through greater consumer spending. The statement stressed that the party\\'s objective is not just to create jobs for statistical purposes but to ensure these jobs provide wages that guarantee a decent standard of living. “Yellow Ghana’s approach is grounded in practicality and fairness, aiming to create a robust economy where every citizen can thrive. \"In conclusion, the goals of the NDC\\'s 24-hour economy policy can be achieved more effectively and sustainably through Yellow Ghana’s Labour Reforms.

              "  'news': 'By: Michael Okuley Ghana’s sprint pair Benjamin Azamati and Abdul Rasheed Saminu have missed the 100m final place in the ongoing Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The duo made a blistering run in the semis to give hope for the final with decent times. Benjamin Azamati who started the day’s race in Heat 1 lane 3 clocked a time of 10.17 to finish 9th which hindered his progress to the finals. Jamaica’s Seville Oblique won the race with a time of 9.81 with the second position going to America’s Lyles Noah with a time of 9.83. Despite becoming the first Ghanaian to make an Olympic Games semi-finals, Benjamin Azamati expresses disappointment over his inability to make the final cut. “One of the best races this season and one of my worst but I can’t complain. I have worked hard to get here and finishing at the semis is good for me. I couldn’t put up a good race but it’s still a learning process.” “The best way is not to give up. I’m getting back to training hard for the subsequent championships. I have mastered the art of controlling my emotions in the block, which has been the greatest lesson”. Debutant Abdul Rasheed Saminu also made a time of 10.05 in Heat 3 to pick the 7th position in the race. The 26-year-old’s record beats Africa champion Ferdinand Omanyala. The Heat race was won by Thompson Kishane with 9.80 and the 9.85 made by America’s Kelly Fred won him the second position and his seasonal best feat. “It’s a great experience as a young Olympian for the next chapter. I didn’t get the quick start as I wanted but I recovered very well. This experience is what I will cherish forever. We are going to work hard for Ghaan in the next competitions”.

              "  'news': 'Quiet manoeuvres in the vast voter enclave of the Ashanti Region have set the tone for a potential long drawn battle as Ghana’s two main political parties battle it out for a chunk of what is available in the 2024 general election. The governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) will unveil a campaign team for the region this weekend, while the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) says its strategy for the region is under wraps, setting the stage for the upcoming shadow boxing for votes in the NPP’s backyard. This is the stronghold of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), where the party has always secured 70 per cent of the votes since 2000. The remainder is left for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the combined effort of all other minority parties sharing the votes in the region. The NPP and the opposition NDC are locked in a fierce contest for votes, each seeking to tip the scales in its favour. In the 2020 elections, the NPP solidified its grip on the region, securing 1,795,824 votes, representing 74.14 per cent of the votes, while the NDC garnered 653,149 votes, representing 26.08 per cent of the votes, leaving the two parties separated by 1,142,675 votes. This was a notable improvement for the NDC from its 2016 performance, where the party garnered 23.03 per cent of the votes. Data analysis shows that anytime the NPP is able to cross the 75 per cent votes in Ashanti Region, it wins the national election. The NDC, which has alternated occupancy of the nation’s seat of government with the NPP in all of the 32 years of the Fourth Republic, comes to the table with a core support base that has remained faithful over the years. It is that group of voters that the NPP targets, as the party’s presumptive vice-presidential candidate, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, stated at his unveiling in Kumasi on July 9, this year. Ambitious target The NPP’s running mate made the clarion call to supporters to deliver 85 per cent of the votes in the region to the party in December during his July 9 unveiling in his constituency. The party itself has been more modest, setting its sights on securing 80 per cent of the votes in the region to cement its dominance. The NPP’s ambitious target is driven by its desire to “break the eight”, a reference to the two-term ruling cycles the NPP and the NDC have enjoyed in the Fourth Republic. The NPP’s dominance in the region is rooted in its historical legacy and cultural affinity. The National Organiser of the party, Henry Nana Boakye, aka Nana B, told the Daily Graphic that: “We are unveiling a campaign team for the region on August 4, to prosecute our campaign for the region and to ensure that we achieve the 80 per cent or higher votes from the region”. Achieving the audacious target requires marshalling all arsenal, including human, financial and logistical resources, to douse the possibility of voter apathy among a population that fetches the party its biggest votes in national polls. The region is crucial for both the NPP and the NDC due to its large electorate and historical voting patterns. The main opposition party, the NDC, is hoping to peel off some of the NPP’s support by building on its growing momentum, aiming to achieve 30 per cent or more of the votes in the region. General Secretary of the party, Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, also told the Daily Graphic that he was hoping that the party’s plans for the region would help the opposition party to achieve the 30 per cent it had set for the region. He, however, declined to mention the party’s strategies for the region. “We have a laser focused eye on the Ashanti Region and will deploy all available resources to ensure that we achieve the 30 per cent votes or more from the region,” he said. For the NDC, a shift in voter sentiments can potentially boost the party’s chances in the region. Political scientists But political scientists say if the NDC can build on its past results and exceed 30 per cent of the votes in Ashanti Region, all things being equal, it could boost the party’s chances of regaining power, while an 80 per cent or more votes in Ashanti Region for the NPP could keep the ruling party in the Jubilee House.

              "  'news': 'As part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2020-2025, and in particular Axis 3 on “Promoting a culture of peace through an educational approach and the enhancement of endogenous resources, cultural heritage, and the strengthening of resilience”, the Timbuktu Institute-African Center for Peace Studies is continuing the “Resilience at the borders” initiative launched with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation a few years ago. The predominantly security-based approach and vulnerabilities in border areas are very often highlighted to the detriment of interactions, which are captured rarely by traditional indicators, research and field studies. The “Living on the border: challenges or opportunities” project, initiated by the Timbuktu Institute with the support of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, has made possible, through exchanges with young people, to discover, according to Bakary Sambe, that “some areas that benefit from very few development initiatives are brimming with potential, especially in terms of building and resilience strengthening to conflict and violent extremism”. The discussions and recommendations highlighted a strong demand for capacity-building and the promotion of youth and female leadership in order to an impetus to a commitment to social cohesion and conflict prevention, in all, especially in these very strategic areas of certain countries in terms of security and stability. All the more so, these areas are often covered by extremist groups from countries that share a historical and cultural continuum with Senegal’s border areas. As part of Axis 3 of its Strategic Plan 2020-2025 on “Promoting a culture of peace through an educational approach and the enhancement of endogenous resources, cultural heritage and strengthening resilience”, the Timbuktu Institute -African Center For Peace Studies- is pursuing the “Resilience at the borders” initiative, with Saint-Louis, Matam and Tambacoun chosenda as pilot sites. These areas, known for their sensitivity, should be given priority in peacebuilding and resilience-building initiatives as part of a preventive approach and to capitalise on the endogenous levers of resilience. The dialogue sessions will begin with speeches by the Regional Director of the Timbuktu Institute and the Representative of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. After the official opening by the Governor of the region or his representative, there will be an inaugural session on the “Regional security situation and the challenges of strengthening community resilience: complementary roles of the State and local populations”, by Dr. Bakary Sambe. This will be followed by a series of presentations on topics such as “Women and conflict, the role of women in Senegalese culture” and “Young people and radicalisation in border areas: risks and resilience factors”. Perceptions of the conflict and of the relationship between the Defence and Security Forces and the population will be discussed at length during the group work, and the strategic formulated recommendations will be presented before the debriefing and closure of the session. The recommendations will be shared with the national authorities as part of the contribution to the development and improvement of the frameworks for action adopted by the State of Senegal and its partners.

              "  'news': 'By Dr. Kofi Amponsah Bediako, Development Analyst Child upbringing does not depend on only one person but on both parents, who bring the child into the world. For biological reasons, we tend to leave the care of the baby for the mother when it comes to breastfeeding, bathing the baby, and other activities that make the baby happy, lively, and healthy. However, child upkeep, care or upbringing is not only the responsibility of the mother but the father as well. When it comes to babysitting, cuddling, singing to the baby and carrying him or her around, among others, fathers can also take up that role. Each of the parents is also expected to support the other when tiredness sets in, when for instance, a baby is awake deep into the night and one is expected to stay awake caring for the child. Since both parents are expected to play a crucial role in bringing up the child, it is necessary to arrange for a period for the father to support the efforts of the mother. It is against this backdrop that the introduction of a paternity leave to create the room for fathers to support the care of the baby is relevant. During the 2024 mid-year Budget Review, the Minister for Finance announced a type of leave, known as paternity leave, to help fathers assist mothers in caring for the newly born. On the face of it, this may not be seen as something of socio-economic value. However, when carefully examined, it will be clear that it contributes to the socio-economic welfare of a newly born child, the nuclear family, as well as the country. This explains why paternity leave is good and important for the family, society, and the nation. For fathers to qualify, employees must provide proof of birth or adoption to their employers. Upon approval, the employers are required to grant a minimum of five days of paternity leave, effective from the specified date in the application. However, a worker cannot be granted more than one paternity leave within a 24-month period. Human growth and development is influenced by many factors such as genetic inheritance, hormonal balance, nutrition, overall health status, and neurological development. All these factors are important, but early care after a baby is born should never be compromised under any circumstance. There is a need to ensure that this scheme of leave is well organised and implemented to achieve the maximum result if it is introduced. More stories here Your email address will not be published.

              "  'news': 'Gold exports jumped to a record high in the first half of 2024. According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission, Mr Martin Ayisi, out of the total exports of US$9.2 billion for the first half of 2024, gold alone accounted for 54% of the total exports, which amounted to US$ 5 billion. This, he said, was the result of the surge in gold prices, especially in the second quarter of 2024, and the increase in production from both small- and large-scale operations. The gold price averaged a record $2 338 an ounce in the second quarter, 18% higher year-on-year and 13% higher quarter-on-quarter. The average price of gold for the month of July is about US$2396 an ounce. Gold reached a new record of US$2482 an ounce on 17 July 2024. Mr. Ayisi has predicted that if the price of gold stays around the average for the month of July or the second quarter, then the full-year outlook for gold will hit US$10 billion or more. The Chief Executive Officer noted that the exports from small-scale mining for the first half of this year is about US$ 1.7 billion and accounted for about 36% of the gold exported by mid-year. He predicted that, on the back of the record price, exports from small scale may be more than US$ 3 billion by the end of 2024. According to Mr. Ayisi revenue from gold goes to reinforce the fact that the mining sector remains the pillar of Ghana’s economy. He, however, indicated that the real benefits of mining to the economy lie in the value addition. He cited the cases of lithium, bauxite, and manganese, and even the local refinery of gold. He was particularly happy about manganese and the strong policy of the Government on value addition. Explaining further, Ghana Manganese Company shall construct a 450-million-dollar refinery to refine manganese ore. This will upgrade the grade from 27 to 40 percent, create an additional 350 jobs, and contribute to revenue. The CEO also referred to the new measures that have been put in place in the area of local content and local participation to ensure that over US$ 2 billion dollars that are spent by the mining companies on local supplies and services are undertaken by Ghanaians. He further mentioned the efforts being made by the Government to ensure the mining companies list on the Ghana Stock Exchange to raise capital for mining projects and lauded the work of the Minerals Income Investment Fund to take equity stakes in mines, all to enhance state and Ghanaian participation in the mining sector. Mr Ayisi called for better environmental management of small-scale mining operations, which is carried out in about 12 regions in Ghana and support about three million livelihoods to ensure the operations do not damage the environment.

The masterly drumming of the women sparked ecstasy among the crowd, who could not help but to sway their bodies and tap their feet to the beats amidst applause. Mrs Elizabeth Tete Mensah, one of the ladies from Accra Number One Branch Band, said the all-female brass band had been a special feature of the Asafotufiami over the years. It was to ignite joy and sustain people’s interest during the festival, noted as one of the activities that mostly drew people to the celebration, she said. Mrs Mensah said she was initiated into the group by her mother and had played for over 30 years, adding that she had also introduced her children into it. Mr Alexandra Katey Nartey, the Financial Secretary, Takoradi Branch Band, said drumming had been a male-dominated art, but the Ada female indigenes had been trained to break the norm. The women’s presence in the group gave it a different dimension, they were phenomenal and captivated the crowd, while promoting women’s participation in brass band music, he said. Previously, he said the band constituted only the elderly in society, but as time went by, they decided to involve the youth to tap into their energy and creativity in playing. “The youth were also added as a way of getting them to come back to their roots and contribute to their community’s development…” he said. “I was born in Kumasi; initially I was not comfortable visiting my hometown.

              "  'news': 'By Mary Agyepomah-Kissi & Kafui Dey Smoothies are more than just a delicious treat or a quick snack. They offer a multitude of health benefits that can help boost your immune system and improve your overall well-being. On the #GTVBreakfast show this morning, Thelma Tackie interviewed two experts—Gracia Helarie Fraikue, a dietician, and Pearlvis Sefakor Tornu, an entrepreneur from Green Café—who shared their insights on the health benefits of smoothies. Let’s delve into what they had to say about the power of these blended wonders. The Nutritional Powerhouse of Smoothies Gracia Helarie Fraikue emphasized that smoothies are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. “Smoothies aid in digestion, improve skin health, and help in weight management,” she noted. By choosing the right ingredients, you can tailor your smoothie to meet specific health goals. Weight Management Made Easy Smoothies can be a great tool for weight management. According to Gracia, fruits like avocados and bananas are ideal for those looking to gain weight, while berries and citrus fruits are perfect for weight loss. However, portion control is crucial. “The quantity of fruits you take is a factor in either gaining or losing weight,” she explained. Nutrient-Rich and Balanced A well-made smoothie is a nutritional powerhouse, offering vitamins A, C, and E, fiber, potassium, and magnesium. These nutrients are vital for maintaining good health and supporting bodily functions. Regulating Sugar Levels Gracia pointed out that while smoothies can help regulate sugar levels, it’s essential to choose fruits with a low glycemic index. Diabetic patients, for example, should avoid high-sugar fruits like pineapples and watermelons. Beyond Fruits: The Power of Vegetables Vegetables can also be incorporated into smoothies, enhancing their nutritional value. Ingredients like spinach, kale, and carrots not only add a nutrient boost but also complement the flavors of fruits. Boosting Smoothie Benefits To maximize the health benefits of smoothies, Gracia recommended adding ingredients like turmeric, ginger, and honey. These not only enhance the taste but also provide anti-inflammatory properties that contribute to better skin and overall health. Meal Replacement or Supplement? Smoothies can be a meal replacement if they contain a balanced mix of nutrients. However, Gracia cautioned against forgoing main meals entirely in an attempt to lose weight. A smoothie should complement your diet, not replace it. Smoothies for Athletes Athletes often consume smoothies for pre- and post-workout nutrition. Pre-workout smoothies provide the energy needed for exercise, while post-workout smoothies aid in muscle recovery and replenishment of lost nutrients. Avoiding Common Mistakes Gracia highlighted some common mistakes to avoid when making smoothies, such as adding too much sugar or high-calorie ingredients. It’s important to maintain a balance of fruits, vegetables, and protein sources. Anti-Aging Smoothies Certain smoothies can support anti-aging. Ingredients like turmeric, carrots, and ginger promote healthy skin and can help you look and feel younger. Pearlvis Sefakor Tornu’s Smoothie Secrets Pearlvis Sefakor Tornu from Green Café shared her expertise on creating popular smoothie combinations. She prepared a green smoothie made with spinach, kale, bananas, and honey, a customer favorite for its delicious taste and nutritional benefits. Ensuring Consistency and Catering to Dietary Needs Pearlvis emphasized the importance of using fresh, high-quality ingredients and maintaining precise measurements for consistency. She also highlighted the café’s ability to customize smoothies to meet various dietary needs, including vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free options. Popular Choices and Recommendations The green smoothie and berry blast are top choices among customers, loved for their refreshing taste and health benefits. Pearlvis also shared that they consider customers’ health goals, dietary restrictions, and personal preferences when recommending smoothies.

              "  'news': 'By Angela Adu-Asomaning According to the World Health Organization, non-communicable diseases of which lifestyle diseases are a part, claim many lives annually, which is over 70% of all deaths across the globe. Of these, over 15 million deaths occur among people in the age band of 30 to 69 years. Lifestyle diseases include atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke; obesity,type 2 diabetes, and diseases associated with smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. Reports say, diabetes, cancer, heart and respiratory diseases will be the leading killers by 2030 if care is not taken to contain them. Heart disease, one of the lifestyle diseases, has remained the leading cause of death at the global level for the last 20 years and it is now killing more people than ever before. The number of deaths from heart disease increased by more than two million since 2000, to nearly nine million in 2019. Heart disease now represents 16% of total deaths from all causes. Deaths from diabetes- another lifestyle disease, increased by 70% globally between 2000 and 2019, with an 80% rise in deaths among males. Diabetes mellitus, cancers and cardiovascular conditions have been identified as the three fatal lifestyle diseases wreaking havoc to many lives. Senior Lecturer and Head of Department of Pathology at the University of Ghana Medical School, Dr Afua Abrahams, says modifiable, non-modifiable and metabolic reasons are the major contributory factors to these lifestyle diseases. Dr Abrahams who also doubles as a Senior Pathologist at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, however said, ”though these diseases are not curable for now, they can be managed or prevented”. She emphasised the importance of adopting healthy lifestyles to combat these diseases. She says there is the need to be active, exercise regularly and eat well balanced meals, avoid addictive things like alcohol and tobacco as well as the need to minimise anger and have good sleep. A Nursing Officer at the Kekeli Hospital in Accra, Blaise Ackom says there is a need to sensitize people on the effects of tobacco smoking, sniffing of glue and other narcotic drugs, especially, among young people. He said intensive education is required to raise awareness on the dire consequences of substance abuse on the human body. He emphasized the need to reduce the intake of junk, oily and fatty foods and avoid red meat, and rather opt for fruits and vegetables. Health is wealth and this common saying holds a lot of weight because there is truth behind it. As a people, we need to make healthy food choices, avoid ultra-processed foods. watch our blood pressure, check our cholesterol levels, watch our body mass, manage our blood sugar levels, quit smoking, go for regular check-ups and adopt regular physical exercise as a lifestyle.

              "  'news': 'By Bright Philip Donkor My journey into the author’s world began with an unexpected digital encounter—a riveting article titled “Development Challenges in an Election Year.” This piece, an exploration of political and developmental dynamics, not only piqued my interest but also paved the way for a meaningful relationship with the author. Through his insightful analysis and engaging narrative, he has transformed from a distant writer into a friend and mentor, offering profound insights into the tumultuous and transformative era of Jerry Rawlings’ rule. In the kaleidoscopic world of Ghanaian politics, where the hues of history and power intertwine in a complex dance, I would be remiss if I did not explore the revolutionary spirit and democratic shifts that defined the era, guided by an author whose intellectual curiosity and personal connection to the subject matter deepen our understanding of Ghana’s political landscape. Professor Jeffrey Haynes is an Emeritus Professor of Politics at London Metropolitan University (London Met), actively shaping discourse on African politics through his scholarly work, guidance on research agendas, and public engagement with the continent’s diverse political landscapes. He specialises in political science, with a focus on political theory, international relations, and comparative politics. His research includes topics such as religion and politics, global governance, and development. Professor Haynes’s deep interest in Ghanaian politics led him to write his PhD thesis on “Rawlings and the Politics of Development Policy in Ghana, 1979-1986,” which he completed between 1984 and 1988. His work is driven by an interest in the politics of underdevelopment under Flt. Lt. Jerry John Rawlings’ regime. This book seeks to challenge simplistic portrayals of leadership and examine the complex interactions between state institutions, civil society, public welfare, and global influences. Personal reflections Upon my first reading of the review copy during my leisure time, I knew it had a vast potential for intellectual trouble. It is that very fact that makes it such a valuable and worthwhile publication. For me, reading the book is just like a rare breed of sweet wine whose taste still lingers in the mouth and makes the taste buds wanting more. The book effectively addresses many of the questions we have pondered about Rawlings’ political ideology, the impact of his governance on Ghanaian democracy, and how his rule influenced the country’s political institutions and policies. Though this is not a book written by Rawlings himself, it illuminates the Rawlings era and democratisation in a manner unmatched by other works. The publication of this book is a significant event. Despite the vibrancy of Rawlings’ nearly two decades of rule, that period remains relatively opaque in our history. And I dare say reading the book has profoundly deepened my understanding of Ghanaian politics. Before diving into this text, my perspective on Rawlings was largely shaped by popular narratives and media portrayals. The author’s meticulous research and nuanced analysis have provided me with a richer, more complex view of Rawlings’ impact. I came to appreciate not only the ideological shifts during Rawlings’ tenure but also the intricate interplay between revolutionary fervor and the pragmatic challenges of governance. Prof. Haynes’ exploration of controversial aspects, such as the murder of judges and economic reforms, challenged my previously simplistic views. The detailed examination of how Rawlings’ regime navigated international pressures and internal power struggles offered new insights into the broader political context of the time. The book has helped me understand the legacy of Rawlings’ policies, particularly their role in shaping Ghana’s transition towards a more democratic and market-oriented society. When Rawlings passed away on November 12, 2020, I was initially numb with disbelief. However, such a day was inevitable. He has left the battlefield he once conquered, and we can now reflect on his legacy and find appropriate words to eulogize him. Beginning the revolution at the age of 32 serves as a testament to his role as a model for young revolutionaries. Those times were filled with mixed emotions—memorable and controversial—giving rise to various theories and rumors about power struggles, personality clashes, and policy challenges in both the PNDC and Rawlings’ NDC administrations. The author says in the preface that _“The book has four objectives. First, I seek to contextualise Rawlings’ initial revolutionary populism in contemporaneous radical military interventions in Africa. The second is to outline the characteristics and political consequences of Rawlings’ revolutionary populism and authoritarian populism which replaced it. The third is to examine the return to multi-party democracy in late 1992 and the following 10 years of Rawlings rule as elected president. The fourth objective is to assess Rawlings political legacy in Ghana following his death in November 2020.”_ Scope Despite the book’s succinctly defined scope, it offers more than what its author suggests. Three significant aspects make this book a historic contribution to our understanding of recent developments in our country. The first is the role played by Rawlings and some of his closest associates in shaping a revolutionary period that began without a clear roadmap. Jerry John Rawlings is often seen as both an enigma and a contradiction. That is why books on him will evoke interest and attract readership. From his abortive May 15 infantile coup attempt, through June 4 to December 31, and the attempted coup by Lance Corporal Giwa and blood cousin Captain Courage Quarshigah’s arrest, Rawlings has been a subject that titillates scholarship and research. That is why the book is a must-read, not only for academicians, historians, and researchers, but also for ordinary citizens and, particularly, the youth who may take our democratic journey and experience for granted. Very well researched and scripted, the writer does a tidy work by digging into nearly all available material on Jerry Rawlings, including talking to persons close to him and even those who he worked but fell apart with his chequered career as three-time Head of State of Ghana from 1979 through 1981 to 1992 and into 2000. Strengths / weaknesses The words of Prof. Haynes are strong because he provides a thorough analysis of Rawlings’ leadership, from his revolutionary beginnings to his role in establishing multi-party democracy. The book’s exploration of both political and economic dimensions of Rawlings’ tenure is commendable. The book situates Rawlings’ leadership within the broader context of African politics, offering valuable insights into the regional and international influences that shaped his policies. Prof. Haynes’ use of extensive interviews and archival materials adds significant depth to his analysis, presenting a well-rounded view of the political and economic challenges faced during Rawlings’ regime. As with any scholarly work, there is a risk of inherent bias, especially given that Prof. Haynes has a long-standing academic interest in African politics. While the book aims for objectivity, there may be an unconscious inclination to emphasize certain aspects of Rawlings’ leadership while downplaying others. Eccentric and controversial elements But the author, who would also add notes to his rich scholarly work, was meticulous and courageous enough to investigate controversial clansmen of Jerry Rawlings such as Prof Kofi Awoonor and others who had an ethnicity agenda that was remotely connected with the plot to plan and execute a coup after lawful elections had been held and a government in place in December 1981. Akata Poree, Adabuga, Courage Quarshigah, Kojo and Tsatsu Tsikata all find space in this rich chronicle of events from Jerry Rawlings and his compulsive march into a democracy that was forced on him and his junta by global development agencies. Such background concerns also included public and global apprehensions about a potential Rawlings dynasty and the influence of the United States. A notable event was President Bill Clinton’s visit to Ghana in 1998, during which he emphasised the importance of democratic principles, and allegedly cautioned Rawlings against deciding to foist himself on the people for a third constitutional term. Murder of the judges, outburst of professional associations The piece is further enriched by Prof. Jeffery Haynes’ analysis of the murder of the judges and its political fallout on the junta, including the outrage directed at Kojo Tsikata and Amartey, who were made scapegoats. It also examines how the junta attempted to gain credibility by creating Civil and Workers Defence Committees, aiming to present itself as inclusive and democratic. The pressure on the junta to reform or face removal, driven by the public’s anger as Rawlings himself described it, added to the junta’s insecurity. This environment contributed to the dissatisfaction among military officers like Alidu Giwa, who, feeling sidelined, attempted a countercoup. The fact that his own investigative team and Committee of Inquiry placed the blame for the murders squarely on Kojo Tsikata led to a loss of credibility among the political, middle class, and professional bodies and some safety needed in illiterate, vulnerable, docile citizens. Economic reforms and press freedom The author was spot on when he notes that it was at this critical point that the regime decided to open up to the West and its agencies in agreeing to economic reform programmes after being turned down by the former USSR or Soviet Union, which failed to buy proposal on reforms submitted by Ghana, with Tsatsu Tsikata and Kwesi Botchwey leading the team to Moscow. In this objective treatise, the author also notes success stories in implementing the World Bank and IMF Ghana Country Programmes that would eventually thaw the socialist nonsense and force the country closer to good governance and constitutionality codes. With the liberalised environment, the previously suppressed independent media became a channel for advocating constitutional rule—a tide that the junta had difficulty managing, despite its use of the antedated Criminal Libel Law intended to intimidate journalists. Eventually, when it led to funding a crony broadcast network, the junta unwittingly began opening the floodgates for a revolution in freedom of the press. This shift diminished its ability to use institutions like the Media Commission and Electoral Commission, for instance, in pushing its propaganda and skewing elections. Interestingly, it turned out according to this book that, the people who had become nostalgic for democratic governance began creating political clubs, following in the steps of the junta, which had created the December 31st Women’s Movement, besides the CDRs and WDCs, and waiting for the day the pressure on the regime to lift the ban on politics, to constitutionally fight Jerry Rawlings and his junta. ‘Revolution and Democracy in Ghana: The Politics of Jerry Rawlings’ stands out as a crucial work for anyone interested in the evolution of Ghanaian politics. The author \\xa0provides a thorough examination of Jerry Rawlings’ impact on the country’s democratic development, combining rigorous research with insightful analysis. The book’s exploration of Rawlings’ transformative leadership, controversial policies, and the political shifts of his era offers valuable perspectives that deepen our understanding of Ghana’s political landscape. This masterpiece is recommended to all segments of the population, including the business community, academia, and politicians. More stories here Your email address will not be published.

He said citizens must solidify the country’s democratic gains by contributing to making independent institutions more robust and resilient.

              "  'news': 'The Bono Regional Youth Wing of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has intensified the electioneering, propagating the economic policies of the party to the voter population, particularly first-time voters at the grassroots. Mr Richard Nkwanayana, a member of the Media and Outreach of the Youth Wing, said it was imperative for the party to reach out to and sensitise the electorate to understand the policies of the NDC to make informed decisions on December 7. In an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in Sunyani on Friday, Mr Nkwanayana said the wing was reaching out to market women and traders in general as well as ‘ghetto boys’, to sensitise them on the ideologies and philosophies of the NDC. Describing the party’s 24-hour economy as a realistic intervention, he said it was imperative for the party to explain the policy to the electorate for better understanding to clearly decide and vote for the NDC. Besides the 24-hour economy, Mr Nkwanayana said the electorate also ought to understand the NDC’s proposed National Apprenticeship Programme (NAP), and the National Women’s Bank (NWB), policies. The implementation of the NAP and the NWB would provide employable skills training to young people and provide interest-free loans to market women and traders to establish or expand their economic activities, respectively. Mr Nkwanayana expressed concern over the growing graduate and youth unemployment, economic hardship as well as increase in prices of basic food items and other commodities in the country, which had worsened the economic burdens of the populace. He said the signs were clear that Ghanaians were dissatisfied and had lost faith in the President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo-led Government, hence the NDC ought to propagate its intentions and economic policies to the masses to give them hope. “That is why the media and outreach unit of the Youth Wing has taken the responsibility to reach out to all the 12 Constituencies to interact with and propagate the ideals and economic policies of the NDC to the voter population,” Mr Nkwanayana stated. “We have intensified the electioneering and seriously reached out to all marketplaces, ghettos, and all corners of the constituencies of our region to make the masses understand the sound economic policies and social interventions of the next NDC government under former President John Dramani Mahama.” Mr Nkwanayana advised the electorate not to vote blindly when they go to the polls on December 7 and be guided by the economic conditions they faced and vote for the NDC to win and alleviate their plight.

              "  'news': 'Mr Yiadom Boakye Akoto, the Head of the Coastal Engineering Division of the Ghana Hydrological Authority (GHA), says 290 kilometres of Ghana’s coastline require some protection against erosion to protect lives and property. Ghana has seen a series of coastal erosions along the coast over the years, causing lots of destruction to lives and property at hotspots, affecting the economy and fishing activities of the communities. Mr Akoto noted that Ghana’s 550km approximate coastline is at various levels of vulnerability to such erosion, noting however that one-third of the coastline (180km) is stable with low vulnerability. The remaining 370km of the coastline was at risk and required coastal protection, he said, and that “out of the 370km at risk, approximately 80km of coastline is protected, leaving 290km requiring protection.” “Places like Aboadze, Shama, and Anlo and the coastal stretch from Winneba in the Central Region, Mumford, and places in the Greater Accra like Kokrobite, Dansoman, Tema Newtown, La, Regional Maritime University, and Ningo Prampram, and the eastern stretch from the Lower Volta Delta to Aflao are all in critical areas falling within the 370km,” he said. Mr Akoto revealed this during a Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) media forum and called for urgent steps to be taken, noting that the rising nature of high sea level and coastal erosion was due to climate change. He said that coastal erosion threats were both natural and man-made, mentioning that sand winning was one of the major causes, which had a dire\\u202fimpact on coastal communities in Ghana. “The daily winning of sand at the shores erodes the natural protection of the coast, which is the sand,” he said, adding that having enough sediment along the shore gave the right slope for the wave to break calmly, but the absence of the sand led to erosion. Mr Akoto stressed the need for effective collaboration among stakeholders in addressing the challenges and curbing the menace and called for increased funding for investment in coastal protection. “As it stands, the chance of losing a whole community, holiday resorts, and properties along the coastal area will impose economic hardship on the inhabitants,” he said. He called for an increase in public-private partnerships with developers as the Government could leverage expertise, resources, and funding to implement effective measures. He mentioned that his outfit was\\u202fconcentrating on protecting the remaining 290 kilometres out of the 370 kilometres of coastline under stress, which need urgent attention, and called on the local authorities to enact bye-laws to protect the coast and cautioned the public to desist from practices that endangered the coastlines. The Ghana Hydrological Authority is responsible for the planning, designing, execution, operation, and maintenance of flood control mechanisms, coastal engineering works, drainage improvement works, and operational and applied hydrology in the country.
